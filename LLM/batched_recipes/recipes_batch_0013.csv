Simple Butter Cookies,"['200 g butter (salted, slightly softened)', '130 g icing sugar/powdered sugar', '¼ tsp fine salt', '1 egg (grade A/size L)', '240 g plain flour/all-purpose flour', '60 g cornstarch', '½ tsp baking powder']",,"Directions:
beat butter
Sift icing sugar into butter, mix until combined with spatula, then beat over medium speed until light and fluffy (about 1 minute). Add salt to egg, mix until the salt has dissolved, add egg gradually into butter, beat until well mixed (about 1 minute).
cookie dough
Sift and mix together plain flour, cornstarch and baking powder, sift again into butter. Combine first with spatula, then mix over low speed with mixer until well combined (about 30 seconds). (Reminder: Mix until just combined, don’t overmix to avoid activating the gluten.)
Put cookie dough into piping bag
Put a small portion of cookie dough into piping bag with piping tip (with closed star shape). (Reminder: Don’t put too much into piping bag at once as it will be difficult to pipe out. If you don’t have piping bag, just shape the dough into balls and lightly press down with fork to create pattern.)
Pipe cookie dough onto baking trays
Pipe cookie dough into round shape (like a flower) onto baking trays lined with silicon baking cloth (or non-stick baking paper).
refrigerate until hardened
Keep the piped cookie dough refrigerated for at least 20 minutes, until hardened before baking in oven (this will help the cookie to maintain its pattern when baked, if you bake it straight away after piping, the pattern will not be clear).
bake
Put the hardened cookie dough into preheated oven, bake at 170°C/340°F for 15 minutes (turn the baking tray in between baking to help the cookies bake evenly).
cool in the oven for 5 minutes
When the baking is done, let the butter cookies cool in the oven for 5 minutes before taking out (this will help the moisture to evaporate completely, the cookies will continue to brown will cooling in the oven). After taking out the baked cookies, preheat the oven again before baking the next batch.
cool completely
Allow the butter cookies to cool completely before storing in air-tight container.",en,True,,False,True

Princess Cake,"['One 8-inch round cake or springform pan; one 8- or 9-inch bowl (2- to 2½-quart capacity); electric mixer; rolling pin; pastry brush; bench scraper', 'Nonstick cooking spray or oil, for the pan', '3 large eggs', '1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar', '3 tablespoons/45milliliters whole milk', '2½ tablespoons/30 milliliters vegetable oil or other flavorless oil, plus more for the pan if needed', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or ⅛ teaspoon fine salt', '1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour', '1/2 teaspoon baking powder', '2 large egg yolks', '3 tablespoons/30 grams granulated sugar', '2 tablespoons/15 grams cornstarch', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk', '1 tablespoon/14 grams unsalted butter', '17 1/2 ounces/500 grams marzipan', 'Powdered sugar, for dusting', 'A few drops of green food coloring', 'A few drops of pink food coloring', '2 cups/480 milliliters heavy cream', '1 cup/226 grams mascarpone', '1/2 cup/75 grams powdered sugar', '2 teaspoons vanilla extract', '1/2 cup/150 grams raspberry jam']",,"Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat an 8-inch round cake or springform pan with cooking spray, then line the bottom with a round of parchment paper and the sides with a strip of parchment. (The spray helps the paper stay in place.)
Separate the eggs into two large bowls (if using a stand mixer, use the mixer bowl for the egg whites). Whisk 3 tablespoons/30 grams of the granulated sugar into the yolks, followed by the milk, oil, vanilla and salt. It may appear split at first, but whisk for 30 seconds, until combined and smooth.
With an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, 10 to 20 seconds, then slowly add the remaining ¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon/70 grams granulated sugar while beating. Raise the speed to high and whisk until you get a thick, dense meringue with medium-stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. It should look like shaving foam. If you lift the beaters, the meringue will hold its shape, but the tip will droop slightly.
Whisk one-quarter of the meringue vigorously into the yolk mixture to lighten it. Sift over the flour and baking powder in one go, then use a flexible spatula to thoroughly combine. You are not trying to retain any air at this stage, so don’t hold back. It will be somewhat thick.
Once combined, gently fold in the remaining meringue in three additions, scraping around the outside of the bowl and through the middle in a capital “D” shape while rotating the bowl counterclockwise to maintain the airiness of the batter. Pour the batter into the lined pan and tap the pan firmly against the counter a few times to help spread it evenly.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the cake is golden and feels firm when pressed. Remove from the oven, then drop onto the counter from about a foot in the air three times (be careful, it will be hot!). This may seem crazy, but it helps to prevent the cake from shrinking too much.
Let cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then, when the pan is cool enough to handle, invert onto the rack, peel off the paper and turn right-side up to cool completely. (If using a springform pan, remove the sides and base.)
While the cake bakes, make the custard: Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and vanilla in a small saucepan until combined, followed by the milk. Take care to make sure it is well combined, paying extra attention to the edges of the saucepan.
Cook the custard over medium heat, whisking continuously, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Once boiling, turn the heat to low and whisk for 30 seconds longer. Turn off the heat, then whisk in the butter. Pour into a heatproof container and press plastic wrap or parchment paper directly against the custard to prevent it from forming a skin. Once cool to the touch, refrigerate to chill, at least 1 hour.
Once the cake and custard have cooled, prepare the marzipan coating and decoration: Pinch off ¼ cup/75 grams of marzipan for the flower décor, wrap well and set aside. For the coating, dust your work surface with powdered sugar, then knead the marzipan with one or two drops of green food coloring until it is an even pale mint green. Always start cautiously when adding food coloring: You can always add more, but you can’t take it away. Add more powdered sugar whenever the marzipan is sticky. If it feels dry or starts to crack, moisten your hands slightly (shaking off any excess water) and knead until smooth. The marzipan should be pliable but not sticky throughout the process. When you are happy with the color, form the marzipan into a 5-inch-diameter disk.
Remove any marzipan that has stuck to your work surface using a bench scraper. (Marzipan has a memory and will take on any lumps and bumps that it rolls over.) Dust the smooth surface with powdered sugar. Roll out the marzipan disk, turning it a quarter way around between each roll to maintain the circular shape, until 14 inches in diameter and ⅛-inch thick. As you work, dust the marzipan and surface with powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking. You can also turn the marzipan over to dust and roll both sides.
You will build the cake in an 8- to 9-inch diameter bowl. Make sure it is clean and dry. Dust powdered sugar on top of the marzipan circle and rub it in to evenly coat it well and make sure it’s not sticky. (If it’s cracking, moisten your hands slightly, shaking off any excess water, knead the marzipan until smooth and roll again.) Flip it over, then roll it up loosely onto your rolling pin. Unroll it over the bowl, dusted side down. Encourage the marzipan to take the form of the bowl by lifting it and gently pressing it into place. Take your time with this to get it neat and tidy, lining the bowl closely without any overlap. The marzipan needs to overhang the edges of the bowl by about 1 inch or else it will slip down. If you need to start again, you can simply remove the marzipan and re-roll it as before, adding more powdered sugar if it’s too sticky or dampening your hands if it’s too dry. Once finished, cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent the marzipan from being exposed to the air and drying out or cracking.
Make the mascarpone cream: Whisk all the ingredients together using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer until very stiff peaks form. This is the cement of your cake, so it needs to be stiff enough to provide structure.
To finish the custard, beat the cooled custard using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer until smooth. Fold in 1 cup/150 grams of the mascarpone cream until thick and airy. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Assemble the cake: Pile 2⅓ cups/350 grams of the remaining mascarpone cream into the marzipan-lined bowl, smoothing it with a spoon or offset spatula. Spread an additional scant cup/125 grams of cream evenly up and around the walls of the marzipan, going all the way to the top.
Using a serrated knife, cut your spongecake evenly in half to form two rounds. Place the top half, cut side up, over the cream into the bowl. It might warp or bend slightly depending on the dimensions of your bowl. That’s OK! Spread the raspberry jam on top of the cake, followed by all of the custard, smoothing it all the way to the edges.
Place the remaining cake half, cut side down, onto the custard. Using the remaining 2/3 cup/100 grams mascarpone cream, fill in any gaps around the sides of the cake. If there aren’t any, spread it all over the top of the cake.
Trim the marzipan lining with scissors or a sharp knife so that there is an approximate ½-inch border once it’s folded up and over onto the cake. (Use any excess marzipan to make more décor.) Lift and fold the marzipan onto the cake, using the palms of your hands to smooth the curved edge around the base to form a very pleasing shape.
Place a serving platter upside down onto the cake and, gripping the bowl and plate at the same time, confidently flip it over. Carefully lift the bowl off to reveal your beautiful princess cake. Use the palms of your hands to gently pat the cake into shape, especially if you’ve used a bowl with an angular base.
Use a dry pastry brush to dust off any excess powdered sugar, then wet the brush for a final touch up, brushing to erase any last bits of dusty sugar. Refrigerate the cake for at least an hour before serving.
To fashion a rose to decorate the top, color the reserved marzipan with pink food coloring, kneading it in as before. Pinch off ½-inch blobs, then roll each into longer strips. Roll the first one up to form the center of your spiral, then place each subsequent strip around to form petals, pinching at the base to hold the flower together. Stick the flower onto the center of your cake using a little water to act as glue. Use any excess green marzipan to create leaves or other decorative flourishes.
The finished princess cake can be refrigerated for up to four days. If you’d like, cover it with a cake dome or overturned bowl.",en,True,,False,True

Butter three (8-inch) cake pans and line each with parchment paper. Butter the parchment, then dust with flour, tapping out the excess.
Make the cake: Add 1 3/4 cups/350 grams of the granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, then zest the lemons directly into the sugar. Use your fingers to rub the zest into the sugar until it looks moist and sandy.
Juice the zested lemons into a small bowl. Transfer 1/4 cup of juice to a large measuring cup and stir in the milk. Let it sit while you prepare the rest of the cake, reserving the remaining juice for the lemon syrup. (The lemon juice will thicken and curdle the milk as it sits.)
To the bowl with the lemon sugar, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, and mix on low to combine. Add the softened butter to the bowl all at once. Mix on low until the butter is evenly distributed and the mixture looks sandy. (A few larger lumps of butter are OK.)
Add the oil, eggs and lemon extract (if using) to the measuring cup with the milk mixture and mix with a fork to combine. With the mixer on low, slowly stream in the milk mixture. When the batter is moistened, stop the mixer and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure there aren’t any dry pockets. Adjust mixer speed to medium and mix for 1 minute more.
Divide the batter among the prepared pans (about 2 heaping cups/520 grams per pan), spread evenly and tap the pans on a countertop to release any large air bubbles.
Bake the cakes until slightly risen and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. The cakes will have a bit of color along the edges, but the tops will still be quite pale.
Set the pans on a wire rack and let the cakes cool for about 15 minutes. Then, run a thin knife along the edges of the pan and carefully turn the cakes out onto the rack to cool completely. (You may have to tap the pans gently on the rack to release each cake.)
While the cakes cool, make the syrup: Measure 1/4 cup lemon juice from the remaining reserved juice. Combine the juice and the remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Cook until the sugar has dissolved, then pour into a heat-safe container to cool.
While the syrup cools, make the frosting: Add the powdered sugar and the 1 cup/226 grams butter to the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium until well combined. Add the cream cheese and mix until just combined and fluffy. Stream in a bit of the remaining lemon juice if necessary to make a fluffy, spreadable frosting.
Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer onto a serving plate, top side up. Brush the cake with lemon syrup. Spread about 3/4 cup frosting evenly over the top of the cake. Place the second cake layer on top of the frosting, top side down, and press gently. Brush the cake with syrup, then spread about 3/4 cup frosting over the top. Brush the top side of the final cake layer with syrup, then carefully place it top side down on top of the frosting. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (be careful not to transfer crumbs back into the bowl of frosting), leaving about 1 1/2 cups frosting in the bowl. (If at any point the frosting softens and the cake layers feel like they’re sliding around, gently push them back into place and set the cake in the refrigerator to firm up.) Refrigerate the cake until the frosting is firm, about 20 minutes.

Add the matzo meal, ginger, shiso, ichimi togarashi and about 1 teaspoon salt, mixing well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
To shape and cook the matzo balls, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Dipping your hands first in a small bowl of cold water, mold about 2 tablespoons of matzo ball mix into the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Quickly and gently slide the matzo ball into the boiling water. Repeat with the remaining mix. You will have about a dozen or so matzo balls. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and let cook for about 20 minutes, until al dente, then leave in the pot but turn off the heat.

Once the oil is hot, carefully strain the blended mixture back into the pot (some splattering might occur), pressing against the strainer with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Reduce heat to low, stirring occasionally, and keep warm.
While the consomé is simmering, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high.

Once shaped, gently press one almond on top of each mound.
Pop the tray into the freezer for 45-60 minutes. This will firm them up and make them easier to dip in chocolate.
While the coconut mounds are chilling, melt your dark chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring between each round until smooth. If needed, add a teaspoon of coconut oil to help thin the chocolate and give it a glossy finish.
Remove the coconut mounds from the freezer. Using a fork or dipping tool, carefully dip each mound into the melted chocolate, turning to coat fully. Tap off any excess chocolate and place back onto the parchment-lined tray.

Make the peanut noodles while the tofu bakes.
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil for the noodles.
While the water comes to a bowl, prep the scallions and garlic. a. Scallions: Trim the roots and any bruised tops. Slice the scallions thinly on a bias. Add to a bowl of cold water and soak for ~10 minutes or until done prepping. Drain the scallions and pat dry. b. Garlic: Grate the garlic, finely mince, or use a garlic press. Add garlic to a small bowl.
Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, then rinse under cold water to bring to room temp. Transfer the noodles to a large bowl.
Sizzle the garlic: Heat the neutral oil in your smallest saucepan over medium-high heat for at least 3 minutes, or until very hot (if you have a thermometer, it should register at 350ºF/175ºC).
Pour the hot oil over the garlic and allow to sizzle. Rest for 1 minute, then stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and white pepper.
Mix the peanut sauce: If using fresh udon, measure out 3 TBSP hot water (45 mL). If using dried udon, measure out ⅓ cup (80 mL). In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter and hot water until it’s loosened. Add in the soy sauce-garlic mixture and whisk until smooth.The sauce will be quite thin at this point, but it will thicken as it coats the noodles.
Pour the peanut sauce on the noodles, tossing to coat the noodles well with tongs. If it feels too thick or tacky, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of hot water. Stir in the drained scallions, chopped peanuts, and optional veggie of choice. Taste, adding a splash of soy sauce or rice vinegar, if desired. Fold in Baked Tofu, if using.

Arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325ºF / 165ºC. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners, ideally foil liners or silicone liners, as paper liners tend to squish the cupcakes. Spray liners lightly with cooking spray or brush with oil (this prevents the cupcakes from getting stuck).
Make the “buttermilk.” Measure out the soy milk and allow it to come to room temperature OR heat in the microwave for 10 seconds, stir, then heat for another 10 seconds, or until at room temp. Stir the vinegar into the milk and set aside to curdle.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Whisk well. Now whisk in the sugar.
Add the melted butter to a medium bowl. Pour in the curdled “buttermilk,” oil, vanilla extract, orange zest, and cardamom if using. Whisk well to combine.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Use a silicone spatula to fold the wet into the dry until the batter is smooth without any flour clumps, taking care to not overmix.
Divide the batter across the muffin tins, filling them ⅔ full (or ¾ at the most; otherwise, the cupcake tops will spread out onto the pan and stick).
Transfer muffin tin to the oven. Bake at 325ºF for 22 to 24 minutes, or until the tops are rounded and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcake comes out clean or with only a few moist crumbs.
Transfer pan to a wire rack and cool cupcakes in the pan for just 5 minutes. Now gently remove each cupcake from the pan (don’t unwrap) and cool completely on the wire rack (this method prevents the bottoms from becoming soggy due to trapped steam).
Once cooled, use an offset spatula or piping bag to frost the cupcakes with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting. NOTE: If using silicone liners, pop the cupcakes out of their molds before frosting.
Store leftover cupcakes (frosted or unfrosted) in an airtight container at room temp for about 2 days. After that, store in the fridge for up to 6 days. Allow to come to room temp before consuming (otherwise, they are a bit dry and not as fluffy/soft).
Chocolate Buttercream Frosting
Sift the sugar and cocoa: Hold a fine-mesh sieve or sifter over a large enough bowl. Add the sugar and cocoa to the sieve and gently tap the side of the sieve to remove clumps and sift the ingredients into the bowl.
Add the softened butter to a medium-to-large bowl. Use an electric handheld mixer on medium speed to beat the butter until creamy and fluffy, about 1 minute. NOTE: You can also use your stand mixer if you prefer.
Add the sifted cocoa-sugar to the butter along with the vanilla, milk, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then gradually increase the speed to high. Beat until smooth, fluffy, and thick and it holds its shape, another 30 to 60 seconds.
Taste, adding more salt as desired. If the frosting is too thick or dry, add a teaspoon of milk and beat again. If too loose or wet, add a bit more cocoa powder and/or sugar and beat until the frosting holds its shape.",en,True,,False,True

Rest - Remove lamb and potato to a tray and loosely cover with foil while you make the gravy.
Gravy:
Drippings - The roasting pan will have meat juices and fat. Tilt the pan so you can scoop off and discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat (the clear liquid that rises to the surface). Make sure you keep the dark brown juices in the pan. If you're short of fat, add butter.
Heat fat - Put the pan directly on the stove over medium heat. Once the fat is hot, sprinkle the flour over and stir for 1 minute.
Thicken - While stirring, slowly pour in the stock. Add soy sauce, then keep stirring as it bubbles gently until it thickens into a maple syrup consistency.

Once melted, let it simmer (as in, bubbling) for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring every now and then, until it gets real foamy, you see little golden specks (wade through foam to see) and it smells nutty & extra buttery.
Cool - Immediately pour into a heatproof bowl, including all those golden specks. Cool to room temperature (~45 minutes), cool enough so it won't melt the choc chips (Note 4)
Dough:
Whisk Dry ingredients in a separate bowl.
Mix Wet - To the browned butter, add both sugars and mix with a wooden spoon. Add the egg, yolk and vanilla. Mix until smooth - it will look caramel.

Hard boil eggs, halve, blitz yolks with Filling ingredients except butter, then blitz in butter. Pipe (18 - 20 pieces), garnish, serve!
Hard boil eggs with centred yolks:
Large pot - Bring a large pot with 15cm / 6 water to the boil. Lower eggs in gently using a spider or slotted spoon. Lower heat a tiny bit if needed to stop the eggs from jostling around so much they crack.
Boil and swirl - Boil eggs for 10 minutes. Swirl the water every minute for the first 6 minutes, using the handle of a wooden spoon. Give the water 4 or 5 fast stirs in one direction to make the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make the yolks cook centred in the egg white (ie no thin broken egg white walls) (Note 4).
Peel - Fill a sink with cold tap water. Remove eggs from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or spider. Leave for 5 minutes until cool enough to handle. Tap the base then peel under water (it's easier).
Fill devilled eggs:
Remove yolks - Cut eggs in half and remove the yolks using a teaspoon.
Filling - Place the yolks and all filling ingredients EXCEPT butter in a small food processor (Note 5). Blitz until yolks are broken up. Add butter and blitz, scraping down the sides as needed, until the butter is blended through. The filling should be creamy (smear with back of spoon to check).
Choose the best 18 to 20 egg white halves. (Note 6) Brush yolk crumbs off the cut surface.
Pipe - Transfer filling into a piping bag fitted with a nozzle of your choice (I use a star). Fill so it's mounded - I do about the same amount as a whole yolk.
Sprinkle with paprika and chives. Serve! (Best enjoyed at room temperature rather than fridge cold as the filling is creamier.)",en,True,,False,True

Don't pierce the flesh and don't cut all the way to the edge of the skin (Note 8). Pat the skin dry with paper towels, sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper.
Cold pan, no oil - Don't turn the stove on yet. Use an oven-proof pan (any type). Place the duck skin side down in the cold pan, no oil required. Place another pan on top to lightly weigh the duck down (keeps skin flat).
Cook 10 minutes - Turn the stove onto medium low. Cook for 10 minutes or until the skin is golden and crispy. Fat will melt out of the duck skin and it will cook in its own fat. (Note 8)

Thai red curry sauce:
Sauté curry paste – Heat the duck fat (from step 6 above) on medium heat in a deep skillet. Cook the curry paste, garlic and ginger for 4 to 5 minutes. It will dry out and darken in colour, and substantially improves the flavour (especially store bought, but even homemade).
Sauce – Add chicken stock, stir, then simmer rapidly to reduce by half (2 -3 minutes). Stir in coconut milk, hand-crushed kaffir lime leaves, sugar and fish sauce. Simmer gently on medium for 2 minutes.
Add ins - Add the beans, simmer for 3 minutes until just cooked. Add the lychees or pineapple, simmer 1 minute. Taste and add a tad extra fish sauce if it needs salt.
Assemble:
Spoon some sauce in to cover the base of a large deep platter or wide bowl.
Slice duck breast, just shy of 5mm / 0.2"" thick. Place on the sauce, fanning it out slightly to expose the pink flesh.
Remaining sauce - Spoon the remaining sauce, lychees etc around the duck, avoiding the duck skin.
Garnish with Thai basil leaves, coriander, chilli and lime wedges.
