It’s important that you don’t crowd the pan. The meat needs air around it to achieve a crisp brown crust. With tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the browned pieces to a bowl to catch their juice. Repeat with the remaining cubes.
2. In the same pot, sauté the chopped carrot, onion, celery, and garlic for about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the tomato paste and stir for about 1 minute.
3. Deglaze the pan. Which is just a cook’s way to say: Add the broth and vinegar, then stir with passion, scraping up all the wonderful brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring until the mixture starts to thicken.
4. Put the meat and its drippings back into the pot. Add 3 cups water, 2 teaspoons salt, a healthy dose of pepper, the bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, sage, and cinnamon sticks.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer with the pot only partially covered for about 90 minutes. This is not a soupy stew, but if the stew starts to dry out, add more water, about a 1/2 cup at a time. Simmer until the meat is fall-apart tender and the liquid in the pan has been reduced to gravy-like status.
6. During the last 15 minutes of stew cooking time, make the gremolata. In a small bowl, mix the parsley, orange zest, thyme, garlic, and rose water. 
Remove the cinnamon sticks and herb stems from the stew pot. Ladle the stew into deep bowls  — bonus points if you also add a light drizzle of olive oil.

5. Push the vegetables and beef to the side of the pan and add another dollop of coconut oil; I used another 1/2 tablespoon or so.
6. Add the scrambled eggs to the fat  in the pan and push the meat and veggies into the egg. Let it rest for a bit so the egg gets a hold of the other ingredients, then gently stir with a wooden spoon. This is where your personal preference needs to dictate cooking time. I like my eggs really well done with brown spots, so I cook the hell out of ’em… you do what you like.

Prepare the go-along vegetables. Wash and slice the vegetables. Place on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Put in the fridge ’til you’re ready to eat.
2. Make the sauce. Place all ingredients in a food processor/blender and blend until smooth. Set aside. (You can also mix by hand if you want an arm workout. Try your non-dominant hand!)
3. Make the beef. Heat 1-2 tablespoons of your favorite fat in a sauté pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and peppers, sauté until vegetables are slightly softened, about 3-5 minutes. Add the ground beef and crushed garlic. Stir fry until the meat is cooked through. To make it really sing, throw in the basil leaves and cook just until the basil is wilted.
4. Serve and eat! Serve everything family style so your fellow foodies can make their own wraps to order. I like to start with a lettuce leaf, add a few slivers of onion and cucumber and some carrots, then top with the meat mixture, and drizzle that with some of the Sunbutter sauce. Just roll up and eat! It’s fun finger food that’s packed with nutrition, bright colors, and a tasty contrast of flavors: meaty richness, cool veggies, creamy sauce, and a hint of fire from the peppers. And because it’s communal and potentially messy, it invites lots of conversation and “try it this way” idea sharing. It represents the best of eating with family and friends.",en,True,,False,False
Stovetop Pork Carnitas,"['3-4 pounds boneless\xa0pork shoulder (6-ish pounds if it’s bone-in; you must use pork shoulder or Boston butt)', '1/2 cup lime juice', '1/2 cup lemon juice', '1 heaping (!) tablespoon ground cumin', '1 tablespoon garlic powder', '1/2 tablespoon salt', '1 teaspoon ground coriander', '1 teaspoon ground black pepper', '1 teaspoon cayenne pepper']",,"1. Cut the pork shoulder into a few large chunks. You don’t want them bite-sized; I make mine about 3-4 inches.
2. Mix cumin, garlic powder, salt, coriander, black pepper, and cayenne together in a small bowl. Place the pork chunks in a plastic container with a lid or a Ziploc bag. Pour in the spice blend, then toss the bag vigorously until the chunks are completely coated on all sides.
3. Place the pork in a large, deep pan. Pour the lime and lemon juice into the bottom, then add water to just cover the meat.
4. Turn heat to high and bring the water to a rip-roaring boil. You want big bubbles! When it’s rolling, turn the heat to a simmer. Keep the pan uncovered. You want it bubble a fair amount, but not be a roiling boil.  While it’s cooking, it will look like uninspired soup. Do not be discouraged!Essentially, you’re waiting for the water to evaporate from the pan, but while the water is evaporating, the powerful acidic qualities of the lime and lemon juice are tenderizing the meat. Yay, science!
5. At about the 2-hour mark, check the pot. The water should be much lower and maybe even almost gone. Now things get interesting… allow all the water to cook out of the pan and watch as the meat magically fries and carmelizes. It is a thing of beauty. But seriously, you need to watch it at this point.
6. Carefully turn the hunks of meat–without shredding them–to brown all sides, then remove the hunks  to a plate and let them rest for 5 minutes before eating.

If you’re using the sesame seeds, heat a large sauté pan or wok over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, toss in the sesame seeds and stir constantly ’til they’re lightly toasted, about 3-5 minutes. Keep an eye on them! They can quickly change from pale white to dark brown in a blink! When you’re happy with the toastiness, remove from the pan and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, scramble the eggs with 1 teaspoon coconut aminos. Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil over medium-high heat in the pan, then add the eggs and scramble until cooked through. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil over medium heat, then sauté the diced onion until it’s tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Things are going to start happening a little faster now. Alert your dining companions that you’re about to “drop the f’rice.” (That’s what I bellow from the kitchen at my house to alert Dave and Smudge that dinner is imminent!)

Prepare the chicken. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the coconut oil. When it’s melted, add the chicken and brown well on both sides, about 3-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a bowl to catch the juices and return the pan to the heat. Add the onions and saute until they’re translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the ginger, salt, pepper, and cinnamon sticks to the pan and stir to combine. Return the chicken to the pan and pour in the water and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer, partially covered for about an hour, until the chicken is very tender
While the chicken is simmering…
2. Prepare the almond dust. Place the dates in a food processor and puree on high until they form a paste. Add the almonds and cinnamon, and process on high until the almonds are chopped very fine and the dates are incorporated. Allow yourself one small bite, then set the dust aside.
3. Prepare the crust. In the food processor, blend the almond flour, dates, salt, and baking soda until combined. Sprinkle the top with the coconut oil cubes and gently toss them in the flour  with your fingers so they’re coated in flour. Using the pulse button on the processor, give the dough 5-7 pulses for about 1 second each. You do not want the coconut oil completely blended into the flour; the mixture should resemble coarse sand. Turn the dough out into a large bowl and using your hands, gently mix in the beaten egg. Roll the dough into a ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 day.
When the chicken is cooked…
4. Cool the chicken. Remove the chicken from the pan and set in a bowl to catch the juices. Measure a 1/4 cup of the liquid from the pan and pour into the bowl with the chicken. Reserve the liquid in the skillet and let the chicken cool completely while you make the eggs.
5. Prepare the eggs. Measure 1 cup of the cooking liquid from the skillet and discard the rest. Return the liquid to the pan and add the parsley. Bring to a boil, then simmer until most of the liquid is evaporated. It should almost look like a sauce or gravy. Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan, stirring gently until they’re set and all the liquid is absorbed. Set aside to cool.
When all the ingredients are cool to the touch…
6. Preheat the oven to 375F.
7. Shred the chicken. Using your hands, pull the chicken off the bones and shred it, mixing it into the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. Add the two egg whites and stir until the chicken is coated.
8. Prep the scrambled eggs. Add the remaining 1 egg white to the scrambled eggs and mix with your hands until the eggs are coated. (The egg whites are a stand-in for sugar and act as a binder during baking.)
9. Make the crust. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and smush the ball into a large, flat disc with your hands. Place it in the center of a 9-inch pie pan and using your fingers, gently press it into the bottom and sides of the pan to form an even crust. This is not as difficult as it sounds; the dough has a texture like playdough.
10. Assemble the pie. Layer half the chicken in the bottom of the pan and top with all of the scrambled eggs. Sprinkle the top of the eggs with half of the almond dust. Add the remaining chicken then top it with the remaining almond dust, gently pressing the dust into the surface. It should end up looking like a traditional crumb-topped pie. Place the pie in the center of the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until the top is very well browned and the edges of the crust are crisp.

Place the julienned zucchini in a colander or wire strainer and toss with the salt until coated. Allow to sit for 20 minutes to drain excess water, then rinse and pat dry with paper towels. (You may be tempted to skip this step; I strongly advise against it. This step insures tender, rather than watery, noodles.)
2. While the zucchini is sweating in the colander, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Mix the almond flour with the coconut oil, sprinkle it with a smidgen of salt, then sauté in the pan, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until it’s toasty brown, about 1 minute. Transfer from the pan to a plate to cool. As it cools, the coconut oil will solidify and make “crumbs,” so don’t worry if it’s just brown dust when you take it out of the pan. Kind of mush the dust together into a pile and let it do its thing.
3. Return the pan to the heat and add the zucchini noodles. Sauté until just tender, about 1-2 minutes. Push the noodles to the side of the pan, and reduce heat to medium-low. Wait a minute; it’s essential that the pan cools down before adding the eggs. Add the olive oil and garlic. When the garlic is fragrant, about 20 seconds, pour in the eggs and allow them to cook until just beginning to set a tiny bit. Mix the zucchini noodles into the egg and continue to stir gently and continuously until the egg is set and clinging to the noodles. Taste, then add salt and pepper to your liking.

In a small bowl, mix the strawberries, lemon juice, and ginger. Set aside. Preheat a gas grill with all burners on high, lid closed, 10-15 minutes.
2. Mix the ground beef with salt and pepper and shape into four patties. Gently press down the center of each patty until it’s about 1/2-inch thick to make a slight depression; this will prevent them from turning bulbous when you cook them. Grill patties, uncovered and without pressing down on them, until they’re seared on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip the burgers and continue grilling to desired temperature: 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for well-done.
3. While the burgers are cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium-high. Pour the strawberries and their juice into the pan and sauté the berries until they’re very soft and syrupy. They should be reduced to about 1/2 cup. Allow to cool a bit.

2. In a small bowl, mix flour, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and cloves with a fork until blended. Pour the seasoned flour into a large ziplock bag, add the chicken livers, and shake gently until coated evenly.
3. In a large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil over medium-high until hot, about 3 minutes. Add about half the chicken livers in a single layer — try to arrange them so they don’t touch. Allow the bottom to brown well and form a crisp crust, about 3-5 minutes. Using tongs, flip the livers, and brown the other side. Set aside to drain on paper towels while you cook the second batch. You may need to add more coconut oil to the pan.
4. Place the livers on a serving plate and garnish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of chopped fresh herbs.
5. These taste their crispy best if you eat them immediately, but since I’m the only person in the house who likes chicken livers, I had a lot to eat as leftovers.

Carefully remove the leaves from the jar and place in the sink or a large bowl. Cover with hot water and allow to soak at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, break the cauliflower into florets, removing the stems. Place the florets in the food processor bowl and pulse until the cauliflower looks like rice. This takes about 10 to 15 one-second pulses. Place “rice” in a large mixing bowl and put the bowl back on the food processor; no need to clean it yet.
2. Heat a dry skillet over medium high heat, then add pine nuts and raisins, stirring often and cooking until the pine nuts are lightly toasted, about 3-5 minutes. Set aside to cool, then coarsely chop. (I like to coarsely chop the pine nuts and raisins so I get a little in every bite.) Add the nuts and raisins to the rice in the bowl.
3. Place the lamb, onion, mint, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor and run the motor until the ingredients form a paté and everything is combined. Add the lamb paté to the rice and mix well. The easiest way to do this is with your hands: run them under a little cold water and dig in.
4. In a large saucepan, place a few reject leaves — the ones that are torn or small — to cover the bottom of the pan. Drain the water from the rest of the leaves and get ready to start rolling…
5. Place a leaf on a flat surface with the shiny side facing down, snip off the stem, and place about 1 tablespoon of filling on the end of the leaf closest to you. Roll from the bottom, fold in the sides, and keep rolling ’til you have a cigar shape. You want to roll them pretty tightly so they don’t come apart during the cooking process. (NOTE: This is different than traditional dolmas where you want to leave a little wiggle room for the rice to expand during cooking. The cauliflower actually shrinks as it cooks, so roll them up tight!) Place the rolls in the pan and nestle them up against each other pretty snuggly. Here’s a handy video to show you how it’s done. (I forbid Dave from shooting my face, but dig my cute polka dot dress!)
6. Cut one of the lemons into thin slices and arrange the slices on top of the dolmas in the pan. Place a heat-proof plate on top of the dolmas and press down, then add water to the pan to cover the plate with about 1 inch of water. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. As soon as the water is rolling, turn the heat way down to a gentle simmer and cook 25-30 minutes, until the leaves are tender but still have a little bite left in ’em.
7. Carefully remove the plate and drain all the water from the pan — you might need to remove the dolmas to do this. Put the dolmas back in the pan and cover wth the lid so they stay hot. In a small bowl, whisk the juice from the remaining lemon with the egg until frothy. Pour over the dolmas, then put the lid back on and let them work their magic. The hot dolmas gently cook the egg/lemon sauce to create a tangy coating.
8. Remove the dolmas from the pan, place covered in the fridge, and wait until they’re chilled. They taste great cold, room temp, or hot — but are best if reheated, rather than eaten immediately when they come out of the pan. I like to eat them cold with a sprinkle of coarse salt and a tiny drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.",en,True,,False,False

Mix with a wooden spoon so the onions are evenly coated in the fat; sauté about 5 minutes until they release their juice. Reduce heat to medium and cook until browned and soft, about 10-15 minutes. Remove the onions to a bowl and save for later.
2. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon coconut oil; heat until shimmering. Sprinkle the liver generously with salt and pepper, then lay the pieces flat in the pan in a single layer. Try to leave a little breathing room around them and cook in two batches, if necessary. Cook undisturbed for 60-90 seconds, until the first side is browned around the edges. Flip each piece with tongs and cook the second side, 60-90 seconds, until browned on the edges. Remove the liver to a plate while you finish the onions.

"Vietnamese Chicken Salad a.k.a., Vietnamese Jicamadas","['1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts', '2 tablespoons salt', '1 teaspoon whole peppercorns', '3 cloves garlic, peeled and\xa0smashed', '1 tablespoon coconut aminos or homemade substitute', '1 tablespoon lime juice', 'a few fresh basil leaves', '1 medium to large jicama', '2 medium carrots, minced', '4 medium radishes, minced', '1 small jalapeño, minced', '1 clove garlic, minced', '2 tablespoons dry roasted cashews, finely chopped', '6-8 large basil leaves, finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)', '10 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)', '1 tablespoon lime juice', '1 tablespoon rice vinegar', '1/2 teaspoon olive oil', '1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional; I like Red Boat)', 'salt and pepper, to taste', 'homemade mayo']",,"1. Credit where it’s due: this idea was inspired by two recipes I read last week: the Food Lovers’ Tacos with Jicama Shells and this recipe on TheKitchn.
2. I brined the chicken first, and I recommend you do the same. However, if you’re in a hurry, you can skip the brining step, and you will be OK. The chicken might not be quite as tender and flavorful, but it will still be very tasty when nestled under the Vietnamese relish.
3. A. I’m not sure that this recipe technically qualifies as fusion cuisine — a.k.a., a mashup of Asian and Mexican cuisine because “tostada” literally means “toasted” and my jicamada is not toasted, nor could it really be toasted, so it’s not really Mexican and, therefore, not really fusion (words matter, people!) — but I like to pretend, so… I just declared myself a fusion chef.
B. This is clearly not authentic Vietnamese food… it’s “inspired by.” I replaced the traditional peanuts with cashews, used basil instead of cilantro, and just tossed together things that I thought would taste delicious, based on my memory of a  bahn mi sandwich I ate on a sunny sidewalk in New York in 2006 (while wearing a white shirt, army green pants, a red plaid tie, and black Converse. I remember every detail of that day because it was so awesomely fun).
4. This is not first date food because you have to eat with your hands and sometimes, just like when you eat tacos (Do you remember what it’s like to eat tacos?!), the toppings fall off onto your plate. But that means when have hoovered in your last bite of jicamadas, you can scoop up the remnants from the plate for one last, perfect bite.
5. These guys are awesome summer food: cool, crisp, flavorful, light, and easy to make. You could make them half the size and serve them at a party, even! The jicamada bed is a sweet, crunchy balance to the peppery bite of the relish, and the little bit of mayo adds a creamy kiss that gets close to recreating the magic of a bahn mi sandwich. You can play around with the ingredients: cucumbers would be a good addition or substitution in the relish, and you can swap in cilantro for the basil.",en,True,,False,False
Slow-Cooker Italian Pork Roast,"['5-7 pound pork roast, boneless or bone in (shoulder, Boston butt… ribs would work, too)', '5-7 cloves garlic, cut into slivers', '1 tablespoon salt', '1 tablespoon Penzeys Italian Herb Mix (or 1 teaspoon each dried oregano+dried basil+dried rosemary)']",,"1. Pat the pork roast dry with paper towels. Use a small sharp knife to make slits all over the pork, then insert the garlic slivers into the slits.
2. In a small bowl, mix the salt and dried herbs, using your fingers to crush the leaves and mix them with the salt. Rub the mixture all over the pork roast, working into the nooks and crannies.
3. Place the pork roast in the slow cooker and cook on low for 14 to 16 hours. As the pork roasts, the pan of the slow cooker will fill with liquid. You have two choices: (1) let it go and pour off the liquid when the meat is finished cooking; or (2) halfway through cooking, remove the lid and carefully pour off the liquid. Put the lid back on the pork and let it continue roasting; refrigerate the liquid in a glass bowl/jar or BPA-free container so the grease can separate from the luscious juice. I like to pour off the liquid so the outside of the roast gets crispier.
4. When the meat is finished roasting, it’s fall-apart tender. You can either shred it with forks, mixing the crusty bits with the interior, tender bits—or break it into serving-size hunks. It’s crazy-good either way. Remember the juice you put in the fridge? Now you can easily skim off the excess fat, re-heat the juice in a pan on the stove, and use it as a sauce for the cooked meat.",en,True,,False,False

Brown the meats. Heat coconut oil in a large, deep pot. Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper, then brown them on both sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the chops from the pot and place in a bowl to catch the juices. Brown the whole sausage links in the same pot, about 10 minutes, and place in the bowl with the pork chops.
2. Make the sauce. You’re going to make the sauce in the same pot, so add a little coconut oil if there’s no fat left in the pan. Cook the onions with the oregano until they’re very soft, about 7-10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cocoa. Sauté until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir, about 1 minute. Add the broth and crushed tomatoes; stir to combine. Nestle the pork chops and sausage into the sauce. Bring to a robust bubble, then cover and simmer, 2 hours. Meanwhile…
4. Prep the meatballs. Preheat the oven to 400F and cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. In a small bowl, mix the water, baking soda and cream of tartar with a fork until combined. Crumble the beef and pork into a large bowl, then add the garlic, tomato paste, vinegar, parsley, salt, Italian herb blend, red pepper flakes, and water/baking soda. Mix well with your hands (or if you want it very smooth, with a food processor or mixer) until combined.
5. Cook the meatballs. Measure 1 tablespoon of the meat and roll into a ball. Line up the meatballs on the baking sheet, then bake 20 minutes, until browned.
6. The final steps. When the sauce has reached its 2-hour simmer deadline, add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer an additional 15 minutes, uncovered. Remove the sauce from the heat and toss in the fresh basil, then taste and add salt and pepper, if necessary.
7. If you used bone-in pork chops, the meat could fall right off the bones; you might need to liberate them from the sauce (lest you choke a dining companion).

Place the garlic, onion, parsley, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika in the bowl of a food processor. In a small bowl, mix the hot water with the cream of tartar and baking soda until the powders are dissolved. Add the baking soda mixture to the food processor and purée everything. If you have large food processor that can handle it, add the meat and process the whole shebang until it’s smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. If you do not have a large food processor, place the beef and lamb in a large bowl, then add the purée and mix well with your hands.
2. Roll the meat into sausage shapes — they should be about 4 inches long and 3/4 inch in diameter. I’m not going to lie to you: this is a pain in the tuches, but it’s worth it because these little suckers are delicious. (For what it’s worth, I tried simply rolling this same meat mixture into meatballs and grilling them — not. the. same. Faster, but not as tasty. You make the call.) As you finish rolling, line up the sausages like little soldiers on a baking sheet. Cover the ćevapčići with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour or up to overnight.
3. Let’s cook ’em! Roast the ćevapčići either on a preheated gas grill or under the broiler. They take about 5 minutes per side to turn a luscious, dark brown on the outside and to cook through in the middle. (In a pinch, you can also pan fry them in a large, non-stick skillet.)

2. Mix the ground beef with salt and pepper and shape into four patties. Gently press down the center of each patty until it’s about 1/2-inch thick to make a slight depression; this will prevent them from turning bulbous when you cook them. Grill patties, uncovered and without pressing down on them, until they’re seared on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip the burgers and continue grilling to desired temperature: 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for well-done.
Note: You can also pan-fry or bake the burgers. On the stovetop, cook in a nonstick skillet, 5 minutes, then flip and continue to cook: 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium, 5 minutes for well-done. In the oven, bake at 400F for 20-25 minutes.

Sprinkle the ribs with salt and pepper. Heat a large, deep pot over medium-high. Add the coconut oil to the pot, and when it’s melted, add the ribs in a single layer and sear on all sides. You want a serious crust, so you’ll probably have to work in batches. As the ribs brown, remove them to a bowl to catch their juices.
2. Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to drippings in pan. (Add a little more coconut oil if you need to.) Cook the vegetables until they’re soft and beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and fry until brown, about 3 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar, water, and thyme. Bring to a boil and cook until it’s syrupy, about 5 minutes.

With a mandoline slicer on its thinnest setting, slice the plantains into coins. Use two wooden spoons to toss the slices in a large bowl with the melted coconut oil.
3. Bake the plantains. Use four coins to make each “tortilla:” Lay them flat on the baking sheet with edges slightly overlapping and sprinkle with salt. While they bake, the natural starches make them stick together. Bake for about 30 minutes until very crisp and beginning to brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with additional salt, if you’re feeling it. Meanwhile…

Heat a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Place the caraway seeds in the hot pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly toasted, about 3-5 minutes. Remove from pan and place in food processor bowl. To the same pan, add your fat of choice. When it’s melted, add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
2. Push the onions to the side of the pan and add the livers in a single layer, leaving a little wiggle room between them. You might need to do this in batches. Brown on the first side, undisturbed, for 2 or 3 minutes, then flip to brown the other side. You want them to remain a little pink in the middle.
3. When the livers are ready, add the cognac to the pan and scrape up any bits of yumminess stuck to the bottom. Allow the cognac to cook off for a minute or two, stirring the livers and onions together. When the pan is nearly dry, remove the pan from the heat and allow the livers to cool to the touch.
4. In the bowl of a food processor, place the livers and all the juices from the pan, hard-boiled eggs, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and pepper. Now you have two choices: (a) Pulse until combined but still kind of chunky for a more traditional chopped chicken liver texture; (b) Purée until smooth. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if necessary. (If you’re feeling hedonistic, you could add 1-2 tablespoons of additional fat at this step to make it richer and creamier.)

Bakso (Indonesian Beef Balls),"['1 pound ground beef', '1 pound ground pork or chicken', '4 tablespoons tapioca starch', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', '1 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon black pepper', '1/2 teaspoon baking soda', '1/2 teaspoon onion powder', '1/2 teaspoon garlic powder', '1/2-inch piece ginger or galangal, grated (1/4 tsp ground ginger okay)', '1/4 cup water', '1 cup beef broth', '1-inch piece ginger or galangal (left whole)', '1 cinnamon stick', '2 black cardamom pods', '4 whole cloves', '1/2 tablespoon fish sauce', '1/2 tablespoon lime juice', '1/2 teaspoon white pepper', 'salt to taste (about 2 teaspoons)', '1 pound Chinese cabbage (choy sum or kai lan), washed and cut into 2″ lengths', '2 carrots, julienned', 'chopped cilantro to garnish']",,"1. Mix all of the beef ball ingredients together with your hands, then transfer to a food processor.  Process the meat until bright pink, finely mixed, and somewhat tacky in texture.  Stop the processor every minute and scrape down the sides with a spatula.  Transfer the meat paste to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and put in the fridge for at least four hours, or overnight if you’d like.
2. Bring a pot of water to boil, then reduce heat until it is gently simmering.  Wet your hands, then grab some of the meat in one hand; squeeze the meat through your thumb and index finger, then scoop away the ball with a spoon and gently drop into the water (pictured below).  Once the ball starts to float, let it simmer for 2 more minutes then fish it out and place it in a bowl of ice water.  Check your first meatball or two to make sure they’re cooked through.  Repeat this procedure with all of the meat; it’s easiest if you have someone making the balls while someone else monitors the balls for doneness and fishes them out.  Once all of the balls are cooked and in the ice bath, strain and rinse them gently with cold water.  At this point, your beef balls are done — enjoy them right away or freeze/refrigerate for later use.  If you want to enjoy them immediately, proceed to step 3.
3. Spoon out any fat or chunks from the water you used to boil the beef balls — it’s going to be the soup base.  Add the beef broth, ginger/galangal, cinnamon stick, black cardamom pods, and whole cloves.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to marry, then fish out the ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves (alternatively, you could put them in a tea bag or cheesecloth and pull it out).  Add the fish sauce, lime juice, white pepper, and add salt to taste.
4. Add the Chinese cabbage and blanch for 30 seconds, then add to the soup bowls.  Do the same with the carrots, but blanch them for only 10 seconds.  Add the beef balls to the soup and return to a simmer, then scoop the balls and broth into the individual bowls.  Garnish with cilantro and serve.",en,True,,False,False

Persian-Spiced Roast Leg of Lamb,"['1 cup chicken broth', '1 boneless leg of lamb (around 4 pounds)', '5 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly smashed', '2 teaspoons dried mint leaves', '4 teaspoons advieh', '4 tablespoons + 1 tablespoon coconut oil or ghee', 'salt and ground black pepper']",,"1. Place oven rack in lower-middle position and preheat to 375F. Place a roasting rack inside a large roasting pan, then pour the chicken broth into the roasting pan. Set aside.
2. Prep the lamb. Cover a work surface with a large piece of plastic wrap. Remove the string or net bag from the lamb, and place it – rough side up – on the plastic wrap. Cover with another large piece of plastic wrap and bludgeon with a meat mallet or rolling pin until the meat is about 3/4 inch thick.
3. Make the spicy fat. Place the garlic, mint, advieh, 4 tablespoons coconut oil (or ghee), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a food processor. Blend until smooth. Rub half the spicy fat mixture on the meat, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Save the remainder of the spicy fat for later. (Am I mistaken in thinking that Spicy Fat could be an awesome band name?)
4. Roll it! Roll the lamb into a tight cylinder and tie with twine. It works best if you wrap it around crosswise every inch or so, then wrap it lengthwise a time or two. I am not skilled at wrapping, and I did it totally half-assed, but it worked out just fine. You don’t need to stress about roast wrapping, but if you want more guidance, you might watch this video. Pat the lamb dry with paper towels, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
5. Brown it. Heat a large, non-stick over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon coconut oil (or ghee). When the fat is hot, about 2-3 minutes, add the lamb and brown it on all sides. This takes a little time ’cause you want a nice brown crust all the way around. Don’t forget to stand the roast on its ends, too. Cook’s Illustrated used tongs in their instructions, but I had to resort to two wooden spoons. The process took about 10 minutes to brown the whole thing.
6. Roast it. When the roast is brown all over, place it on the rack and slide the whole thing into the oven. In a microwave or saucepan, melt the remaining spicy fat mixture, and every 10-15 minutes, brush the outside of the roast with the spiced fat. The meat will be cooked to medium rare when the internal temperature registers 130-135F, about 45-55 minutes. I like mine a little more well done, so I roasted for 60 minutes. Transfer the lamb to a cutting board, cover with a tent made from a big-ass piece of foil, and let it rest 10-15 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch thick slices and devour. If you have juice/drippings in your roasting pan, you can strain them through cheese cloth, then use as a drizzle sauce for the sliced lamb.",en,True,,False,False

Place the basil, parsley, walnuts, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes in the bowl of a food processor and purée until it forms a uniform paste.

2. Place the ground chicken in a large bowl, then add the pesto. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the water with the cream of tartar and baking soda  — it will fizz a little. Add to the bowl with the chicken and mix until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Cover and refrigerate at least 20 minutes and up to overnight.
3. While the meat is chilling, start the sauce. Heat a large non-stick skillet over low heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is warm, about 2 minutes, add the crushed garlic and when it’s fragrant, about 30 seconds, add the tomatoes. Stir to combine and bring to a very low simmer.
4. Remove the chicken dough from the fridge. Moisten your hands with cold water and shake to remove excess. Measure a rounded tablespoon of chicken and roll into a ball between your palms. Place gently in the tomato sauce. Repeat until all the balls are nestled into the sauce. It’s OK if they touch each other and aren’t completely submerged.
5. Cook the meatballs in the tomato sauce, covered, about 25 minutes. Remove the lid from the pan and allow to cook another 5-10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a little.

Place the rice in a large bowl, add the melted coconut oil and salt, then toss until coated. Spread in a single layer on the baking sheets and roast in the oven until tender, 20 minutes. Turn off the oven and keep the rice warm inside until serving time.
3. Make the sauce. Drain the water from the dates. In a blender or food processor, purée the dates with the sriracha and sesame oil; set aside.
4. Make the vegetables. Place the bean sprouts, scallions, and rice vinegar in medium bowl. Toss to combine and set aside to allow the sprouts to “pickle” while you make the rest of the meal. Cook the carrots, zucchini, and spinach separately, following these instructions: Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a large, non-stick skillet. Add 1 clove minced garlic, and as soon as it’s fragrant, add the vegetable. Toss with two wooden spoons, stir-frying until crisp-tender. When the vegetable is cooked to your liking, add a few splashes of coconut aminos, tossing to coat. Remove from heat, add a dash of sesame oil, and transfer cooked vegetable to a serving dish. Repeat with the remaining vegetables. Suggested order of cooking: carrots, zucchini, spinach.
5. Make the meat. In a small bowl, whisk the ginger, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, applesauce, and coconut aminos. Re-heat the skillet you used for the vegetables over medium-high and crumble the ground beef into the pan. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry until the meat is no longer pink and the mushrooms are wilted. Add the sauce and cook until heated through and glazed, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meat to an oven-safe dish and place in the oven with the rice while you cook the eggs.
6. Make the eggs. In the same pan, heat coconut oil for 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Add the eggs one at a time and allow the white to set around the edges before adding the next egg. Cook until the whites are opaque and slightly crisp around the edges, and the yolks are just beginning to set, about 4 minutes.

Super Simple Spring Salad,"['1 large head butter lettuce, washed and torn into bite-sized pieces', '2 large spring onions (or 4 scallions), white & dark green, thinly sliced', '1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped', '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice', '1 tablespoon red wine vinegar', '1 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil', 'salt and ground black pepper, to taste']",,"1. Place the lettuce, onions, and parsley in a very large mixing bowl.

Gluten-Free Tabbouleh,"['1 head raw cauliflower', '1/2 tablespoon coconut oil, melted', '2 seedless cucumbers', '4 ripe tomatoes', '4 cups curly parsley leaves (about 2 bunches)', '1 cup fresh mint leaves', '6 scallions', '1/3 cup lemon juice (about 3 lemons)', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper', 'zest of 1 lemon', '1/2 teaspoon Lebanese seven-spice blend (optional –\xa0recipe here)', '1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil']",,"1. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Cover a two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a food processor to “rice” the cauliflower: Break the cauliflower into florets, removing the stems. Place the florets in the food processor bowl and pulse until the cauliflower looks like rice. This takes about 10 to 15 one-second pulses. You may need to do this in two batches to avoid overcrowding. In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower rice with the melted coconut oil, then divide the cauliflower between the baking sheets. Spread it into a single layer so it can toast in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes or so, checking at 15 to make sure it’s getting golden but not burning. (Mine got pretty dark, and it retained a nice bite, even after being tossed with the dressing.)
2. Cut the cucumber and tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice, place in a colander, sprinkle generously with salt, and let the vegetables “sweat” out their excess moisture while the cauliflower is in the oven.
3. Wash the parsley then either pat dry (with paper towels or a clean dish towel) or spin in a salad spinner. Repeat with the mint. When the herbs are clean and dry, use a sharp knife — not the food processor — to finely chop them. I think it’s nice when you can recognize the leaf for what it is in tabbouleh, so I don’t mince the herbs as fine for this salad as I do for Turkish Chopped Salad. Place the herbs in a large mixing bowl.
4. Trim the scallions and slice them very, very thin so they’re almost shaved. Add to the parsley.
5. When the cauliflower is toasted, remove from the oven and allow to cool. While it’s cooling, drain the cucumbers and tomatoes of the released liquid, then add the vegetables to the parsley. Toss with a rubber scraper to combine.
6. In a small bowl, use a fork to mix the lemon juice, salt, pepper, lemon zest, and Lebanese seven-spice blend. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while you continue to mix with the fork. Then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss gently, but with purpose, until all the ingredients are coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour so the flavors can blend.",en,True,,True,True

Ajvar,"['5-6 large red bell peppers', '1 medium eggplant (about 1 pound)', '6 cloves garlic, unpeeled and wrapped in a piece of aluminum foil', '1 clove garlic, peeled and minced', '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', 'juice of half a lemon', '1/2 teaspoon aleppo pepper (optional)', '1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper', 'salt and ground black pepper, to taste']",,"1. Roast the peppers, eggplant, and garlic.
On a gas grill: Heat the grill on high, with the lid closed, for about 10-15 minutes. Place the eggplant, peppers, and foil packet of garlic directly on the grates and roast until the skins of the peppers and eggplant are blackened and blistered. (It took mine about 5-7 minutes per side, for a total roasting time of roughly 25 minutes.) It seems scary, but you want the skins to be uniformly blackened; watch this video for a good demonstration.
In the oven: Preheat the oven to 475F. Cover a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, then place the peppers, eggplant, and foil packet of garlic on the sheet. Roast until blackened and soft, about 30 minutes.
2. When the vegetables are roasted, set the garlic packet aside and place the peppers and eggplant in a large glass bowl, then cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the vegetables steam for 15 minutes.
3. Remove the garlic from the foil, peel off the skin, and place the roasted garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Carefully remove the skin of the eggplant, use a spoon to scoop out the seeds, and place the flesh in the food processor with the garlic. Blend until just puréed, then remove to a large mixing bowl.
4. Remove the skins, stems, and seeds from the red bell peppers. Place in the food processor and pulse until chopped, but not puréed; you want it to have a bit of texture. I pulsed mine about 5 times. Add the red peppers to the bowl with the eggplant.
5. To the veggies in the bowl, add the minced raw garlic clove, olive oil, lemon juice, aleppo pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well with a wooden spoon or rubber scraper, then taste. Add salt and pepper, mix well, and taste again. Adjust seasonings to your liking, then place in a covered container in the refrigerator to allow flavors to meld.

They are freakin’ delicious.,"['2 large-ish organic Japanese sweet potatoes — long and thin is better than short and fat', '2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted', 'salt']",,"1. Use Japanese sweet potatoes. You know that I’m all about the “You Know How You Could Do That” variations, but some recipes require you to not monkey around with them too much. This is one of those recipes. (Although there is some “You Know How You Could Do That” fun at the end). You maybe be tempted to ask me if varieties other than Japanese sweet potatoes will work, and I must ask you to abstain. I didn’t test all varieties of sweet potatoes, but I did try the regular ol’ orange sweet potatoes (usually jewel or garnets) carried in most grocery stores, and they were too wet and not nearly starchy enough. Here’s the thing: sweet spuds are cheap and kitchen experimentation is fun. If you’re curious, you can always try other varieties and see what happens; I just can’t guarantee you’ll get the same results as this recipe. (Here’s more on Japanese sweet potatoes, in case you’re not familiar.)
2. Set expectations appropriately. Please keep in mind that white potato french fries get super crunchy because they’re very starchy and are surrounded by boiling-hot fat while they cook. These sweet potato fries are baked in the oven. They do get crisp, but they don’t get “white potato french fry” crisp. Set expectations appropriately, and you will be very happy with these. (And yes, you could deep-fry these, but I’m not a deep-fry kind of person. I’m not afraid of fat, but I’m not swimming in it, either.)
3. Use a wire rack. Yes, you really should use the wire rack in the instructions. I know that needing extra kitchen equipment is sometimes a pain, but you probably cook and eat at home a lot. It’s worth the investment in yourself and yummy food. Plus, they’re super handy for lots of kitchen chores. I have this one.
4. Use the microwave. I know some people have concerns about microwaving food, and it’s not the most elegant cooking method, but it serves an important purpose in this recipe. Microwaves suck the moisture out of food, and removing some of the moisture from the sweet potatoes is what makes them crispy.",en,True,,True,True

Basic Zucchini Noodles,"['4 zucchini, julienned with a julienne peeler or spiralizer (about 4 cups)', '1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil', 'salt and ground black pepper, to taste']",,"1. Place the julienned zucchini in a colander or wire strainer and toss generously with salt until the strands are lightly coated. Allow the zucchini to sit for 20-30 minutes to remove excess water. Rinse with running water, drain well, and pat dry with paper towels. Now you have two choices: got directly to step 2 or… for absolutely al dente noodles that do not get mushy, return the noodles to the colander and place in the fridge, uncovered, for 1-2 hours. This allows the strands to dehydrate even further.
2. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add the prepared zucchini noodles. Sauté them in the dry pan until just tender, about 1-2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and drizzle the olive oil over the noodles, stirring gently to coat the strands. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",en,True,,False,False
