Place the trimmed beetroot in the middle of a large piece of foil on top of a baking tray. Drizzle generously with olive oil and sprinkle over some salt
Seal the beetroot in the foil tightly and then roast the beetroot in the oven. Small beets (~100g) will take 50–60 minutes, medium beets (~200g) will take 70–80 minutes and large beets (~300g) will take around 90 minutes
To check if the beets are done, open up the foil and pierce them with a butter knife or chopstick. Once cooked they should be soft enough to pierce all the way through. If your beets are different sizes, take smaller ones out as they cook
Either set the beetroot aside until cool enough to handle, or place them in a bowl of water to cool them down faster

Prepare your crust, press it into your springform pan, and bake as the recipe directs. Let cool completely. You can do this step first if it’s awkward to press the crust into the pan with the foil already wrapped around it. Also, the oven racks can pierce your foil wrapping which defeats their entire purpose.
Alternatively, you can wrap your pan in foil & bag before pressing in the crust if you don’t want to wait for the pan to cool down completely after baking the crust to prepare the water bath. It’s personal preference, either way will work.
Prepare your springform pan:
To seal off the springform pan, place a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil underneath the pan. You want the wide heavy-duty stuff that creates bigger sheets of foil to completely encompass the base of the pan. Gently fold the edges up and around the pan. Repeat twice so there’s three sheets of foil, to ensure a waterproof seal.
Optional Bonus Step: Place the foil-wrapped springform pan inside an oven bag. Roll down the oven bag and fold the top down so it’s flush with the edge of the pan.
Bring your kettle of water to a boil.
A kettle is really the best option since you’ll avoid spills and splashes. If you don’t have one, bring your water to a boil in a pot then pour into a large heatsafe glass measuring cup with a spout.
Prepare your water bath pan:
Once your crust is cooled and your water is boiling, pour the cheesecake batter into the cooled springform pan. Place the springform pan inside your bigger water bath pan. Place both pans on the middle oven rack into the preheated oven.
Carefully pour the boiling water into the water bath pan, pouring only halfway up the sides of the springform pan. You want enough water that it won’t evaporate, but not so much that it’ll splash into your batter.
Bake as the recipe directs:
When baking a cheesecake in a water bath, the directions are generally to bake at 325°F for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. The cheesecake is done when the top looks dry but the center still wobbles and jiggles like jello. It should not be liquidy at all.
Turn off the heat and crack the oven door to cool:
This step is optional, but further helps to prevent cracks from forming. Turn off the oven, crack open the oven door (a wooden spoon can be helpful to keep the oven door open), and allow the cheesecake to cool inside the oven undisturbed for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Remove the springform pan:
Carefully remove the springform pan from the water bath. Unwrap the foil and transfer the pan to a cooling rack. Run a thin-bladed flexible knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools).
Cool, then chill:
Let the cheesecake cool completely to room temperature on the rack before moving to the fridge to chill. Once chilled, remove the springform pan and serve.",en,True,"[""American"", ""European""]",True,True,
How to Temper Chocolate,"['16 ounces (454 grams) baking chocolate, (finely chopped)']","[{""ingredient"": ""baking chocolate"", ""heat_processed"": true}]","Tempering Chocolate by Seeding:
In a double boiler, melt 2/3 of the chocolate, stirring often, until the thermometer registers around 115°F, but absolutely no higher than 120°F. If tempering milk or white chocolate, heat to 110°F. Remove from the double boiler. Make sure all equipment that comes in contact with the chocolate remains completely dry. Any water will cause the chocolate to seize.
Gradually seed in the remaining chocolate to bring the temperature down, stirring vigorously and constantly. Stir until the temperature drops to 84°F. This can take some time, usually about 15 minutes, so just be patient - it will come down to temperature! A glass bowl will take longer to cool. Speed this process up by carefully placing the bowl of chocolate into an ice bath, making sure not to get ANY water in the chocolate.
Reheat the chocolate briefly by placing the bowl back over the double boiler for 5 to 10 seconds at a time, stirring, until it reaches 89°F. This is the “working temperature.” Do not leave the chocolate over the water or let it exceed 91°F.
You’re done! Test your temper by dipping a small piece of parchment into your chocolate. Let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes. The chocolate should be smooth and firm. If it’s streaky or runny, try stirring in more chocolate to the mixture to bring the temperature down further.
Tempered chocolate can be tempered over and over again. You want to keep the working temperature of about 89°F when working with it. If it goes far below that temperature, set it back over the double boiler until it is 89°F again. If it goes much above that temperature, add more seed chocolate to drop the temperature.
Tempering Chocolate by Microwave:
Put 2/3 of the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50% power in 1-minute intervals, stirring between each interval, until melted and smooth. The chocolate should only be between 100 – 110°F.
Add remaining chocolate in small amounts while stirring. Be sure that the pieces are completely melted before adding more.
The chocolate will thicken and become cool, shiny, and smooth as you continue stirring and “seeding” it by adding additional small amounts. When it has reached the range 84-91°F, the chocolate will be tempered and ready to work with.",en,True,"[""French"", ""Italian"", ""German""]",True,True,

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Spray with nonstick cooking spray or grease with butter.
Make the dough:
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast, barley malt syrup/sugar, and 1/4 cup of the water. Whisk to combine. Let stand for 5 minutes or until frothy.
Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups water, flour, and salt, and stir to combine. Mix on low speed until combined.
Increase speed to medium and knead for five minutes until the dough is elastic and smooth and doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl or your hands, adding more flour if needed. This will be a very dense dough, so be careful not to step away from your mixer in case it decides to jump on the counter.
Shape the pretzels:
There is no need to allow this dough to rise. Remove the dough to a clean work surface (do not flour). Divide into 10 equal pieces (each should be about 100 grams). Roll each piece against the counter or between your palms into about a 24-inch long log. The thinner the log, the crispier the pretzels. The thicker, the softer the pretzels.
Shape the log into a letter U. Cross the arms placing one over the other, then twist them around each other once. Bring the ends down to the bottom of the U and gently press to stick. Place on two greased parchment-lined baking sheets.
If you prefer softer spongier pretzels, allow the shaped pretzels to rise for 30 minutes before bathing in the lye.
Prepare the lye bath:
Refer to the safety disclaimer in the blog post before using lye. If lye isn’t an option, see the baking soda bath directions below. Place safety gloves and goggles on, and a face mask too if you prefer. In a well-vented area, place a plastic or glass container (do not use metal) on top of a few pieces of parchment paper to protect your counter from splashes. Carefully sprinkle the lye into the water. Use a silicone spatula to carefully stir the lye to dissolve. The lye is dissolved when the water looks clear.
Dip a shaped pretzel into the lye bath for about 30 seconds. Remove to the prepared greased parchment-lined baking sheets. Use a paring knife to score two slices into the thickest part of each pretzel. Sprinkle with pretzel salt as desired. Repeat until all pretzels have been lye dipped, scored, and salted.
Bake the pretzels:
Bake both trays at 400°F for about 16 minutes, alternating the trays halfway through the baking time for even baking, until deeply golden brown. Bake for less time for softer pretzels and more time for crispier pretzels.

Add half of the creamed butter and sugar mixture (it should weigh about 330 grams). Stir with a rubber spatula into a cohesive dough. Mix in the chocolate wafers, reserving some for garnish.
To the remaining butter and sugar mixture, add in the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat on low speed to combine. Mix in the chocolate wafers, reserving some for garnish.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Over high heat, bring a large pot of water to a boil (the water should be deep enough in the pot to submerge an apple). As the water heats, remove the apple stems from each apple and insert a popsicle stick about 3/4 down into each apple. Once the water has come to a boil, turn off the heat. Submerge each apple for 15-20 seconds while holding onto the popsicle stick. This won’t cook the apples at all, but will remove any wax on the apples, helping the caramel adhere to the apples. Place the apples on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
Once they're just warm to the touch, thoroughly dry the apples with a paper towel. Store in the fridge until the caramel is ready for dipping.
Make the caramel:
In a medium stainless steel heavy-duty saucepan, combine water, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir frequently with a whisk until the sugar has dissolved completely. The mixture should begin to boil after approximately 4 minutes.
Once the mixture has come to a boil, attach a candy thermometer to the pan, making sure it’s not touching the bottom of the pan. Let the mixture simmer without stirring until the syrup has become dark brown in color and the temperature is about 315°F (8-10 minutes).
Carefully add the cold heavy cream to the pan. The mixture will begin to pop and bubble at this point. Constantly stir the mixture with a silicone whisk until the caramel reaches 250°F (about 7-9 minutes).
Remove caramel from heat and carefully stir in the vanilla. The mixture will bubble slightly as the vanilla is added. Be careful not to stir too much as this can create air bubbles in the caramel. Carefully transfer the caramel to a heat-resistant bowl. Cool for 5-10 minutes, or until just warm.
As the caramel cools, prepare your additional toppings, if using.
Dip the apples:
Holding the caramel apple stick, quickly dip the cold apples one at a time into the just-warm caramel, tilting the apple as needed to coat all sides of the apple. Let the excess caramel fall off by either swirling the apple around or gently scraping the bottom of the apple against the edge of the bowl. Place the apple back on the parchment-lined sheet tray to fully set. Repeat with the remaining apples.
If you wish to add additional toppings (such as nuts, crushed Oreos, sprinkles, etc.), immediately roll the freshly-dipped apples in the toppings after coating in caramel, as the caramel will set quickly. If you’d like to dip your caramel apples in chocolate, allow 10 minutes for the caramel to fully set before dipping in or drizzling with chocolate.
If at any point you notice your caramel beginning to thicken (the cold apples can cool the caramel quickly), reheat in the microwave for about 10 seconds before dipping the remaining apples.
Allow caramel apples to fully set. If not enjoying immediately, store the apples wrapped individually in plastic wrap in the fridge.

This is to bump up the fat content of the milk.
Place the milk on the stove and bring to a boil, while stirring occasionally to ensure the milk doesn’t scorch on the bottom.
As soon as the milk starts boiling, turn it off and add the lime juice or vinegar to it. At this point, it should begin curdling. Stir gently, you don’t want the curds to break up too much.
Let the milk sit for about 15 minutes for the curds and whey to completely separate; you should see the yellowish whey separate from the cheese-like curds.
Meanwhile, lay a cheesecloth on a colander (I’m using a steamer) and place the colander in a deep-ish saucepan to catch the whey.
Pour your whey-curd mix into the cheesecloth, and let the whey drain away completely.
Now we have to wash the curds with some cold water to stop them from cooking further and to remove the residual lime/vinegar taste.
Once the water has drained, you’ll be left with crumbly cheese curds. You can use the paneer right away at this point, if your dish calls for crumbly paneer, like the paneer bhurji.
If you want solid cubes of paneer that you can use in gravies etc, fold the cheesecloth over the curds until you have a rectangular package, then place a heavy weight on top of the cheesecloth, like this saucepan, filled with water.
Weigh it down for about 45 minutes, then gently transfer the paneer to a cutting board and slice into cubes.
You can use this immediately, if you like a soft paneer, or you can leave them in the refrigerator for a few hours to let it firm up for frying or for use in gravies.

If your chicken breast includes a tender, carefully remove it by slicing it off with a sharp knife. The chicken tender cooks faster and can be used in another dish or cooked separately.
Pat dry the chicken breast with paper towels to remove any moisture. This ensures a better sear.
Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper evenly on both sides.
Preheat your oil in a pan over medium heat.
How to Cook Whole Chicken Breast
Place the chicken breast in the preheated pan. Allow it to cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes to get a good initial sear.
Flip the chicken breast and sear the other side for another 2 minutes.
Continue cooking, flipping the breast every minute or so to promote even cooking and to prevent any part from burning. This frequent flipping helps manage the heat distribution and ensures that each side gets enough heat without overcooking.
Sear the edges briefly by holding the chicken vertically against the pan with tongs. This should be done towards the end of the cooking process, taking about 30 seconds for each edge.
Check for doneness with a food thermometer in the thickest part of the breast, ensuring the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
How to Cook Butterfly Chicken Breast
Lay the chicken breast flat on a cutting board. Holding a knife parallel to the board, slice the chicken horizontally, stopping just before you cut all the way through; then open it like a book.
Cook the butterflied chicken breast for about 90 seconds on each side. The increased surface area allows for quicker, more even cooking. Using a food thermometer to check for doneness is optional but recommended if you aren’t sure.
How to Cook Tenderized Chicken Breast
Place cling film over the chicken breast on a sturdy surface. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound the chicken breast, especially the thicker part of the breast until the chicken breast is a more even thickness.
Cook the tenderized chicken for about 2 minutes on each side. Using a food thermometer to check for doneness is optional but recommended if you aren’t sure.
Post-Cooking
Let the chicken breast rest for 5 minutes after cooking. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it juicier and more flavorful when sliced.",en,True,"[""Italian"", ""Chinese"", ""Japanese""]",False,False,
