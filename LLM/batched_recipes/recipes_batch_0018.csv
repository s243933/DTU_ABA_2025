Cooking potatoes - Rinse the potatoes very well in fresh water. Then boil 1 large potato or 2 medium sized potatoes in a 2 litre pressure cooker or in a pan with enough water.
If using a pressure cooker, then pour water just about covering the potatoes. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon salt and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles. Once the pressure settles down naturally in the cooker, then only open the lid. Drain the water and place the potatoes in a bowl.
You can also cook the potatoes in the Instant Pot or in a pan adding water as required.
Let the potatoes cool or become warm at room temperature.

Peel and chop the potatoes. Finely chop 1 small to medium sized onion and 1 medium sized tomato. You can also chop 1 green chilli if you want. Chop some coriander leaves too.
Roasting puffed rice
Take the puffed rice (murmura) in a pan. On a low heat stirring often dry roast the puffed rice. If your puffed rice is already crispy and crunchy then you don't need to roast them.
Roast the puffed rice for 2 to 3 minutes they become crisp. You don’t need to brown them. Let the puffed rice cool at room temperature.
Making bhel puri
Assemble everything before you begin. Keep the chutneys in a bowl. These chutneys stay well for about a week in the fridge. So you can keep the leftovers in the fridge.
In a bowl now take the chopped boiled potatoes, onions and tomatoes. You can also include some boiled moong beans or steamed moong bean sprouts at this step.
Add sweet chutney, green chutney and red chutney. You can add the amount of chutneys as per the taste you want in a bhel puri.

Making green chutney
Take all the ingredients for the green chutney in a grinder jar.
Add 1 teaspoon water (optional) and grind coarsely. Since the coriander and mint leaves are rinsed, the moisture from them helps in grinding.
Then add 2 tablespoon hung yogurt or thick curd.
Grind to a smooth chutney. Remove in a bowl and keep aside. You can even refrigerate the chutney.
Making veggie salad
Thinly slice onion, grate carrots and shred the cabbage or thinly slice them. Also thinly slice capsicum (bell pepper).
Take all the veggies in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon chaat masala, 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Also add salt as per taste.
Mix very well and keep aside.
Kneading dough
In a mixing bowl or pan or a large tray, take whole wheat flour, ½ tablespoon oil and salt.
Then add ½ cup water in parts. First you can add ¼ cup water and add the remaining required amount of water later.
Begin to knead. Add water as required and knead to a smooth soft dough.
Cover the dough and keep aside for it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
Making roti
After 20 to 30 minutes, divide the dough into small or medium sized balls. This depends on the size of the wraps you want to make. You can also make mini wraps.
Dust the dough ball with some flour. Then gently roll to thin roti. The roti should not be thick. If required while rolling, you can add some more flour.
Place the roti on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook the base till you see blisters appearing on the roti or the roti is ¼ᵗʰ cooked. Do note that the tawa or skillet should be hot. So cook on a medium-high to high flame. On a low flame, the roti will become very crispy or hard.
Then flip roti. spread some oil all over.
Then flip again when the second side is ½ cooked.
Spread some oil on this side too. You will see golden blisters on the roti.
Flip once or twice more for even roasting. Remove and keep the roti in a roti basket or in a warm casserole. Prepare all rotis this way.
Making paneer tikka
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low and add the marinated paneer cubes. Add the entire marination. Since I had used hung yogurt, I added the entire marinated mixture as the hung yogurt marination had coated the paneer pieces very well. But if you have used yogurt which has a thin consistency, then just add the paneer cubes.
After a minute turn over the paneer cubes.
Pan fry the paneer cubes turning often till the marination is cooked and the paneer becomes soft.
Keep on stirring and turning them at intervals. Also use a well seasoned pan or a non stick pan, so that the paneer cubes do not stick to the pan while frying.
I cooked the paneer for about 4 minutes on a medium-low heat. Do not cook too much as then paneer will become dense, cook on medium-low flame. Timing will vary with the thickness of the pan, intensity of the flame etc.
Once the paneer is done, remove the pan from the flame and keep aside.
Assembling & making paneer kathi roll
Take one roti.
Spread the mint-coriander-curd chutney over it.
Now place the paneer tikka cubes in the center.

Ensure that the cooked rice is warm or at room temperature before you move to the next step. As mixing the tempering mixture in hot rice will cause the tender rice grains to break.
Making jeera rice
Heat oil in a small pan. Add cumin/jeera.
Let them crackle. They have to be fried well otherwise you will taste uncooked cumin in the rice.
Add the green chilies. Stir for a few seconds. No need to brown the chilies.
Add the tempering to the hot or warm rice.

First grease a round baking pan of 7.5 inches diameter with oil. You could also line the pan with a parchment paper. Or use two round cake pans (6 inches diameter) and divide the batter equally between two pans.
Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius/392 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sift whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda on a plate. Use good quality cocoa powder.
In another pan or bowl, take sugar.
Add cold water. Stir and mix until all the sugar dissolves.
Add oil. Stir briskly for 2 to 3 minutes so that everything is mixed well and emulsifies. Use any neutral oil.
Add lemon juice and vanilla extract. Stir and mix again.
If you do not have lemon juice, use 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.
Add the sieved dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Using a wired whisk, mix everything well until you get a smooth batter.
Ensure that there are no lumps in the cake batter. The batter has a medium thin consistency.
Pour the cake batter in the prepared cake pan or pans.
Tap the pan/pans on the countertop, so that the extra air bubbles are let out.
Baking chocolate sponge
Placing the pans in the center rack of your oven, bake the cakes in the preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius/392 Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 mins. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven, do keep a check.
For baking in a convection mode of microwave oven, preheat the oven at 180 degrees Celsius/356 Fahrenheit degrees for 15 minutes. Then bake the cake at 180 degrees Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for the 30 to 35 minutes.
For doneness check the sponge cake with a tooth pick. The tooth pick should come out clean.
If the tooth pick is sticky, then place the cake back in the oven and continue to bake for some more minutes.
Place the pans on a wired tray and let the cakes cool at room temperature.
Note that before frosting let the cake cool completely at room temperature or wrap the cake with a cling film and refrigerate for a couple of hours. You can keep the cake in a covered box and refrigerate.
Whipping cream
In a stand mixer take the the cold whipping cream and icing sugar/confectioner's sugar/powdered sugar.
At the highest speed, whip until the cream becomes stiff. This process will vary depending on the power of your mixer.
To check, just invert the bowl. If the cream does not fall, the cream has stiff peaks. Be sure not to over-whip your cream.
Remember to chill the cream in the refrigerator at least for a day or two before you use it.
If you have used the Indian brand of Amul cream it may take 8 to 10 minutes to whip.
Assembling
If you have baked one cake, then slice the cake neatly from the center with a large knife or serrated knife. You can also use dental floss to slice the cake into two.
Place one layer of the cake with the bottom side facing you. If the top of your cake is domed, then slice the top domed portion evenly so it will lay flat.
Make a sugar syrup dissolving 1 tablespoon sugar in 3 tablespoon water.
Brush the cake lightly and evenly with this sugar syrup. You can also use rum or wine instead of sugar syrup.
Frosting the sponge layers
With a spatula spread about ¼ or ⅓ of the whipped cream on top of the cake.
Then add a layer of finely chopped glazed red cherries. You can use canned red cherries, glazed cherries or fresh sweet cherries.
Sprinkle grated chocolate or chocolate shavings all over.
Cover with the second cake and brush the top with the sugar syrup.
Spread again ⅓ part of the cream on the top evenly. Spread on the sides of the cake too. If you have a rotating cake stand, this will make frosting the cake much easier.
TIP: If you don’t have a cake stand, then use a small, flat plate covered with aluminum foil and place the cake on it before icing. The foil covered plate along with the cake is kept on a heavy board. This way you can easily rotate the foil covered plate while spreading icing on the sides.
Making Black Forest Cake
Add the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag and use any decorative nozzle. Decorate the cake however you like.
Place whole cherries on top of the cake. Top with some chocolate shavings or grated chocolate.
Now cover the sides of the cake with the chocolate shavings. Take some chocolate shavings in your fingers. Gently pat and press them on the cream layer with your fingers.
Turn the cake stand as you go on placing the chocolate shavings on the cream layer all over the sides. Some chocolate shavings will fall on the the cake stand. Collect these and use them for the decoration on the sides.
Cover the cake with a large bowl without it touching the sides and place in the fridge for the cream icing to set. Keep to set for 3 to 4 hours or overnight.
When the cream icing has set well, slice and serve eggless black forest cake.

Firstly measure all the 3 ingredients and set aside - sugar, gram flour and ghee.
Sieve the gram flour once or twice. This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing gram flour in the sugar syrup.
Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces.
Making sugar syrup
Now take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to use a heavy and large aluminium or iron kadai. Please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.
Add ½ cup water in the sugar.
Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.
Stir so that the sugar dissolves.
Melting Ghee
Meanwhile also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top. Let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim.
The ghee has to be hot when we add it in the gram flour mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.
Adding Gram Flour to Sugar Syrup
Let the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution come to a boil and then add the gram flour.
Add the gram flour in three to four portions. First add some of the gram flour.
With a wired whisk, stir the gram flour briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.
With one hand using a spoon, add the gram flour and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.
Finish of all the gram flour this way.
Stir very well, so that the gram flour has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup.
Adding Ghee
Then add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the hot ghee.
You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the gram flour mixture after you add ghee.
As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the gram flour with a spoon or spatula. Using a ladle, with one hand, add ghee and with the other hand mix it with a spatula.
Then add the second portion of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the heat to a medium-low or medium.
This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix thoroughly.
Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.
Cooking Mysore Pak Mixture
All the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten gram flour mixture.
On a medium-low to medium heat with non-stop stirring cook the gram flour mixture.
You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. So continue to cook and stir. The mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan.
While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt.
So you have to stir nonstop and scrape. Do use a flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the gram flour mixture.
When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.
When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the heat.
If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak.
Setting Mysore Pak
Immediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the pan. It falls in one lot and you don't need to use any spoon for it.
Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.
Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down.
If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed. You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates.
Once warm or cooled, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. The mysore pak block falls of easily.

Rinse ¼ cup basmati rice a couple of times till the water runs clear of the starch.
Then soak the rice in enough water for 15 to 20 mins.
Blanching almonds - Heat water in a small pan or pot. When the water comes to a boil then switch off the flame and then add 10 to 12 almonds to it. Cover and keep aside for 30 minutes. Then peel and slice almonds. This is an optional step.
Cooking rice
Meanwhile, when the rice grains are soaking, take whole or full fat milk in a heavy wide pan or saucepan or kadai.
Keep the pan on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals so that the milk does not stick at the bottom of the pan.
Let the milk come to a boil.
Take 1 tablespoon milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let the milk become warm. Then add a few saffron strands in the milk. Keep aside.
After the milk begins to boil, drain all the water from the rice and add it to the hot boiling milk. mix very well.

Rasgulla Recipe (Soft & Spongy),"['1 litre whole milk', '2 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice (or add as required)', '2 cups sugar (or raw sugar)', '1 litre water', '1 tablespoon milk (- optional)', '1 teaspoon sooji ((rava or cream of wheat) or all purpose flour or cornstarch)', '1 to 2 tablespoon rose water (or kewra water or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder)']",,"Making chenna
Take whole milk in a pan and keep it to boil on a low to medium heat.
So when the milk is heating up, line a strainer or bowl with a cheese cloth or muslin.
Keep on stirring the milk at intervals so that the froth is not formed on top and the base does not get browned or the milk solids get stuck to the bottom.
When the milk comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to its lowest. Add 1 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice. First add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and stir. If the milk has not curdled completely, then add 1 tablespoon more. Keep the lemon juice handy with you.
Depending on the quality of milk, you may need to add 1 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Stir after adding the lemon juice. Sometimes I have added 1 tablespoon lemon juice and the milk has curdled and sometimes I needed to add 3 tablespoons too. Vinegar also can be added instead of lemon juice.
Another option is curd/yogurt. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons of yogurt or more if required. With yogurt you don't need to rinse the chenna in water later.
As soon as the milk curdles, switch off the heat. The milk should curdle completely with the green watery whey. If the milk does not curdle, then add ½ to 1 tablespoon of lemon juice more.
Now pour the curdled milk in the cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer or bowl.
Gather the muslin from the sides and rinse the chenna or coagulated milk very well in running water. This brings down the temperature of chenna as well as removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the chenna.
Now squeeze the muslin with your hands very well, so that excess water is drained from the chenna. Remember there should not be excess water or moisture in the chenna as then the rasgulla will break when cooking.
Place a heavy weight on the chenna for 7 to 8 minutes. You can also hang the chenna for about 30 minutes.
Making chenna balls
After 7 to 8 minutes, remove the cheesecloth from the chenna. Note that the chenna should not have too much moisture nor be too dry.
Add 1 teaspoon sooji or rava or semolina. You can also add all purpose flour (maida). Adding either of them helps to bind the mixture.
First mix the sooji with chenna and then begin to knead.
With the heels of your palms mash the chenna and knead. Keep on collecting the chenna from the sides and continue to mash and knead.
This kneading process is very important and also decides the texture of chenna. When you feel your palms becoming a bit greasy, its time to stop. Just a bit of greasiness is required.
Avoid kneading to an extent where the whole chenna becomes greasy. I kneaded for about 10 minutes as I have very light hands. So depending on the quality of chenna and the pressure you apply while kneading, you can take more or less time. Note that the chenna should just begin to get greasy.
Knead to a smooth ball of chenna.
Now pinch small portions from the chenna and roll them between your palms to a smooth round ball.
Prepare all small balls this way. Cover all the chenna balls with a moist muslin or kitchen towel and keep aside.
Making sugar syrup
In a large pan, take 2 cups sugar and 4 cups water.
You have to use a large pot or pan so that there is enough space for the rasgulla to cook and increase in size. You can also use a stovetop pressure cooker. I used a pot measuring 8.5 inches in diameter and 4.5 in height - a 3.4 litre stainless steel pot.
Keep this pan on stovetop and heat the sugar solution. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. I kneaded the chenna and cooked the sugar syrup simultaneously. You can also do this way.
Add 1 tablespoon milk and stir. Adding milk helps in removing impurities. If there are no impurities then you don't need to add milk and directly proceed to step 6.
Once the sugar solution becomes hot, the impurities begin to float on the top.You can either remove it with a spoon. Or strain the impurities in a cheese cloth/muslin lined strainer.
Now from the purified sugar solution, reserve ½ cup in a cup or mug. This ½ cup of sugar solution we will be adding to the cooking rasgulla.
Reserve another 1 cup of the sugar solution in a serving bowl.
Making rasgulla
The rest of the 2.5 cups of sugar solution you add it back to the same large pot and bring it to a boil on a medium high heat.
Slid the rasgulla gently into the sugar solution.
Once all the rasgulla have been added to the sugar solution, shake the pot. Don't stir the rasgulla with a spoon. Just gently shake the pot.
Cover immediately with a lid and let them cook. Keep the heat to a medium or medium high.
After 4 minutes, open the lid and add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Shake the pan. Adding this reserved sugar solution ensures that the temperature and consistency of the sugar solution is maintained and the sugar does not cook to its thread consistencies.
Cover again and continue to cook.
After 4 minutes, again add ¼ cup of the reserved sugar solution. Cover and again cook for 2 minutes. I cooked for 10 minutes. The timing will vary depending on the thickness & quality of pan, the depth of the pan and heat intensity.
To check the doneness
There are two ways. First place the rasgulla in a bowl or cup of water. If the rasgulla sinks to the bottom its cooked.
Second method is to press a small portion of the rasgulla with your finger. If the pressed portion bounces back to its original shape, its cooked
Once they are cooked, switch off the heat and keep the pan down on the countertop.
Soaking in sugar syrup
Now take each rasgulla with a spoon and place it in the bowl containing the 1 cup of sugar solution. Cover and keep aside.
Let the sugar solution in which the rasgulla were cooked, become warm. Then add this to the serving bowl containing the rasgulla.
Once the whole mixture has cooled down, add 1 to 2 tablelsoons rose water.
If you don't have rose water you can also kewra water (pandanus extract) or ½ tsp cardamom powder. Stir gently and allow them to be soaked in the sugar syrup for 30 minutes.
Serving & Storage Suggestions
You can serve the rasgulla now or refrigerate them and serve later cold or chilled.
When serving place the required amount of rasgulla in each serving bowl. Pour a few tablespoons of the sugar syrup in each serving bowl. If you prefer garnish rasgulla with some slivered almonds or pistachios.

First cook noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles in hot boiling water and cook them.
Once the noodles are cooked al dente, then drain the water from the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in water.
Drain any water and set aside.
Chop the veggies in thin long strips or matchsticks. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them. Slice the green bell pepper (capsicum) in thin strips or matchsticks. For the french beans you can slice them very thinly, diagonally or finely chop them. Chopping takes time, so you can use a food processor to ease up the work.
Please note you can use your choice of veggies.
Making stuffing
Now heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium and add the spring onion whites.
Stir and then add all the chopped veggies.
Increase the heat to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes. If the heat becomes too high while stir-frying, then reduce it and continue to stir-fry
Add crushed black pepper powder, finely chopped celery (optional) and soy sauce.
Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste.
Mix everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles.
Season with salt. Add less salt as soy sauce is already salty. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry.
Switch off the heat and add the spring onion greens. Stir and keep the vegetable filling aside. Let it cool at room temperature.
Preparing sealing paste
In a bowl, mix the all purpose flour or cornstarch and water.
Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.
Stuffing Spring Rolls
Now take the spring roll wrapper. If you are using the wrapper recipe which I have shared, then keep the cooked side facing you. Make sure that the wrappers are at room temperature before using them.
Now with your fingertip or a pastry brush, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the veggie stuffing on one side. For a larger sized wrapper add more of the vegetable stuffing.
Wrapping Method 1
Gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.
Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently.
Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
If you are using square wrappers, then do check the recipe video in the post to see the wrapping and folding.
Wrapping Method 2
Another method is to roll halfway. Then spread the batter on the sides.
Seal both the sides from sideways. Spread some batter on the sealed edges.
Then bring the open side on top of the spring roll. Press gently and seal it.
While working with the spring roll wrappers, use light force from your hands, otherwise they may break. If there is any small tear then just spread some of the batter on it to close it.
Now place all the spring rolls with the sealed edges facing down on a plate. Your hands will become messy when stuffing the spring rolls.
Deep frying veg spring rolls
Heat oil at the deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).
Gently slid a spring roll in the hot oil. Keep the heat to medium. If the oil is not hot enough, then they absorb oil and become soggy.
Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time.
Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.
Fry till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. These spring rolls get fried quickly.
Remove the fried veg spring rolls with a slotted spoon.
Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Fry the remaining rolls in batches.

Mix the butter in the hot milk very well.
Making whole wheat pancake batter
Then add this mixture to the dry ingredients in the bowl. With a wired whisk mix very well.
Break lumps with whisk and make a smooth batter. A few tiny lumps are alright in the batter.
The pancake batter is of a pourable consistency and not thick. If the batter looks thick, then you can add ¼ to ⅓ cup more of hot milk. Depending on quality and texture of whole wheat flour more milk can be added.
Set the pancake batter aside.
Making eggless pancakes
Then heat a well seasoned heavy skillet or frying pan. Spread ½ to 1 teaspoon softened unsalted butter or oil on the pan.

Rinse the eggplant in water and then pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Cut the eggplant from its base up-to an inch away from the stem without breaking it apart.
Cut on four sides or directions as shown in the step-by-step guide above. The eggplant has to be whole when you place it on the stove-top.
Pull apart the cut sides gently and check for worms or any black spots. Discard the eggplant if you see any worms in it.
If the eggplant looks clean and without worms, then proceed further. Optionally you can spread a light layer of oil all over it.
Keep it for roasting on direct flame on the stove-top. Keep the flame to medium-low or medium.
Note that as the eggplant cooks some of the juices and drippings will fall which you can wipe later. I don’t recommend placing or covering the sides of the stove-top burner with aluminum foil as they can burn and be dangerous.
You can also grill the eggplant in the oven. But then do note that you won’t get the smoky flavor in the eggplant.
Secure the eggplant between tongs and keep on turning it after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that it is evenly cooked.
Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a fork or knife check the doneness. The knife should slide easily in aubergine without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools.
Smoking Eggplant (Optional Step)
You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the eggplant. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Carefully heat a small piece of charcoal on flame with the help of tongs or by placing it in a wired metal fire-proof rack above the flame, till it becomes smoking hot and red.
Make small cuts on the roasted eggplant with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.
As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.
Whether you have charcoal smoked the eggplant or not, peel the charred skin when it cools. Chop finely or you can even mash it.

Reduce the heat to medium or medium-high, so that the water continues boiling but does not bubble over. Stir the pasta in intervals and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or according to package directions.
The pasta should be al dente, or feel free to cook longer if you like a softer texture or are making a cold salad.
Once cooked strain the pasta in a colander.
For a cold salad, rinse the salad in fresh water or drizzle some oil on them and mix gently - to prevent the pasta from sticking.
Making mayo dressing
Take the mayonnaise, extra virgin olive oil, dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, ground black pepper, sweet paprika, sugar and salt as per taste in a mixing bowl.
Mix very well.
Check the taste of the dressing and feel free to add more seasonings to suit your taste. You can add more sugar too.
Making pasta salad
Add the cooked pasta.
Add in the chopped veggies - onions, capsicum, carrots. Add the finely chopped celery, parsley and sliced olives if using.
Toss and combine well so that the pasta and veggies are coated with the mayo dressing.

Serving suggestions
Serve pasta salad as a main dish with your preferred Italian-inspired sides.
For a lighter meal serve with fresh vegetables - cucumber, radish, carrots or greens - like spinach or kale, either as a raw salad or steamed.
Pasta salad is great for brunch or an afternoon lunch, or even as a hearty snack between meals.",en,True,,False,False

Rinse the methi leaves in running water a few times getting rid of any dirt or mud clinging on them. Then drain them really well and chop finely.
In a mixing bowl, take whole wheat flour, gram flour, sorghum flour and pearl millet flour. I have used millet flours but you can skip them if you don't have. In this case, simply add 1.25 cups whole wheat flour and ½ cup besan.
Add all the ginger and green chilli paste, followed by the spice powders - red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder.

You need to plan ahead and soak the sago pearls. It is very important to soak the sago really well.Important: Please refrain from using un-soaked or under-soaked sabudana to avoid scalding or burns as they will burst and shatter in oil when frying.
First optionally, using a colander or mesh strainer rinse 1 cup sabudana lightly twice draining all the water.
Soak the sabudana or sago in water for 5 hours at least or overnight. I soaked the sago pearls overnight and by morning they had become soft.
When properly soaked, the sabudana pearls will be tender without any hard center. When you press the pearls between your forefinger and thumb, they should get mashed easily with a floury moist texture on your fingers.
If you feel some hardness in the center, then soak for some more time. Drain all the water really well from the soaked sabudana.
There should not be any water logged in the soaked pearls. Water will make the patties moist and sticky. The patties will soak up a good amount of oil while frying making them loaded with oil. So drain the water really well.
You can opt to gently and lightly press the soaked pearls in the strainer with a spoon or spatula. Or set aside the pearls in a strainer (keeping a bowl beneath) for some 20 to 30 minutes dripping of any extra water.
After draining the water thoroughly transfer the sabudana in a mixing bowl and set aside.
Cooking Potatoes
Scrub and rinse 4 medium-sized potatoes thoroughly in water first.
1. Stove-top pressure cooker: Place the potatoes in a 3 litre cooker. Add water which just about covers the potatoes. Pressure cook potatoes for 10 to 12 minutes or 4 to 5 whistles on medium heat.When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid and check the potatoes. Pass a knife or fork through the center of the potatoes and it should slide easily without any resistance.
2. Cooking in a pan: Take water and add peeled and chopped potatoes. The water should cover the potatoes. Add a 2 to 3 pinches of salt if preferred.Cover and simmer potatoes until fork tender. Drain the water really well. When the potatoes are tender, using a strainer, drain all the water.
3. For Instant Pot cooking: Place a trivet in the inner steel of your Instant Pot. Add 1.5 cups water. Place the rinsed potatoes on the trivet. Seal with the lid and position the valve to sealing. Press the manual/pressure cook button and set the time to 10 or 12 minutes with high pressure option.After you hear the beep when the pressure cooking is complete, wait for 5 minutes and then do a quick pressure release. Remove the potatoes with tongs and place them in a plate or tray. Check the potatoes to see if they are cooked tender with a fork or knife.
Let the potatoes become warm. Later peel and then chop them or mash them.
Roasting Peanuts
On a skillet or in a shallow pan, roast the groundnuts/peanuts till they become crisp and crunchy.
Cool and then coarsely powder in a mortar-pestle or in a dry grinder. You can even make a fine powder.
Making Sago Mixture
Add the mashed potatoes and coarsely ground roasted groundnuts to the sabudana in the mixing bowl.
Add edible rock salt, cumin seeds, sugar, ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves and lemon juice to the sabudana . Mix the entire mixture very well.
Now take some portion of the mixture in your hands and shape them into flat round vada or patty. Set aside.
Repeat until you use up the entire dough mixture.
Making Sabudana Vada
Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai. Add a tiny ball made from the mixture.
Fry it on medium flame. If this ball does not break while frying, then you are good to go.
If it breaks, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of rajgira atta (or amaranth flour) to the mixture and mix well.
Now gently place the vada in the oil. Keep the heat to medium or medium-high while frying. If the oil is warm, the vada will absorb a lot of oil and become soggy.
Add the vada for frying depending on the size of the kadai. Do not crowd the kadai or pan.
When one side gets golden, then only flip the vada. Otherwise, don't even touch as they might break if not cooked.
Turn over a couple of times so as to fry the sabudana vada evenly. Fry until they are crisp and golden
Remove them with a slotted spoon. Place on kitchen paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry the remaining batches of the patties this way.
Serve Sabudana Vada hot or warm.
Serving Suggestions
Sabudana Vada can be made for Hindu fasting days or an evening snack too. It is crispy and delicious and thus tastes great with simple Coconut Chutney and even sweetened Curd (Yogurt).
To make the sweetened curd, you will just need to add some sugar to the curd and mix it. If short of time, you can even serve with sweet Tamarind Chutney or tomato ketchup.
You can also enjoy it with Coriander Chutney.
Make Ahead Options
To make ahead, boil, peel, mash and store the potatoes in your refrigerator a day prior. Roast peanuts and powder them. Refrigerate them for 1 to 2 days.
You can soak the sabudana a day earlier and keep it in the refrigerator after draining the water.

Whole milk gives a slightly thicker consistency and is richer. You can opt to make the cold coffee with skimmed milk or low-fat milk. If you decided to add either, then reduce the ¼ cup water to about 2 to 3 tablespoons.
Blend for 1 to 2 minutes or until the milk is mixed evenly with the coffee concoction and you see a nice frothy layer on top.
