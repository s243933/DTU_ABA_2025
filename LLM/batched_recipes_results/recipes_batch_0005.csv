Start by washing and draining the strawberries. Thaw them in a colander over a bowl and reserve the juice if using frozen fruit.
Hull the strawberries and slice them. The size of the slices is up to you, I tend to halve the smaller strawberries and quarter the larger ones. Leave them a bit on the large side, as they shrink during canning, and very small pieces will fall apart during cooking.
Bring a few quarts of water to a boil on the stove and blanch the strawberries for 30 seconds to 1 minute until they're heated through. Work in batches, and be gentle with the fruit so it doesn't fall apart. Remove them with a slotted spoon and keep them warm while making the clear gel mixture.
Combine sugar and clear jel in a large pot, big enough to hold all the fruit comfortably. Add cold water or cold juice to the pot and whisk to dissolve the clear jel completely. This is important! Do not turn on the heat until the clear jel is fully dissolved into the water.
Turn on the heat to medium-high and whisk continuously until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken. As soon as it bubbles, add lemon juice and cook for 1 additional minute.
Turn off the heat and fold in the drained berries.
Immediately fill the canning jars with the mixture, taking extra care to de bubble the jars as the mixture will be thick. Leave 1-inch headspace.

Choose flowers that are in full bloom and avoid any green parts or stems, which can introduce bitterness. Gently pull the petals from the flowers and place them into a heatproof jar or bowl.
Make the Lilac Tea: Pour 4 cups of boiling water over the lilac petals, making sure they’re fully submerged. Let them steep for 15 to 20 minutes. For added color, muddle in a blueberry or two. Lilacs don’t give off any color in tea, so your jelly won’t have their lovely color unless you add a few blueberries into the mix for color.
Prepare Your Canning Equipment (optional): Get your water bath canner ready, and make sure you have clean canning jars and lids. You’ll need enough water in the canner to cover the jars by at least 1 inch, and the canner should be preheated to a gentle simmer. Canning is optional, but if canning, you can prepare the canner while your tea is steeping before you’ve made the jelly.
Strain the Tea: After steeping, strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the petals. What you have left is your lilac tea, a beautifully fragrant base for the jelly.
Add Lemon Juice: Stir in the 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. The lemon helps balance the floral sweetness and also aids in setting the jelly.
Boil with Pectin: Bring the lilac tea to a boil in a large saucepan or jam pot. Once boiling, sprinkle in the powdered pectin, stirring constantly until it’s fully dissolved. Let the mixture boil for a full minute. (Don’t add the sugar until the pectin has boiled in the liquid for 1 full minute.
Add the Sugar: After the pectin has dissolved, add the sugar. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved into the mixture. If you’re using a low-sugar pectin, you can adjust the sugar amount to your liking. The standard ratio is 1:1—4 cups of lilac tea to 4 cups of sugar, but you can reduce the sugar if you prefer a lighter, less sweet jelly.

Choose blossoms that are fully open and vibrant, but make sure they are free of pesticides or other chemicals. Gently pull the petals from the flowers, discarding the stems and green parts. You’ll need about 2 to 4 cups of fresh petals, depending on the size of your blooms.
Steep the Petals: Place the peony petals in a heatproof jar or bowl. Pour 4 cups of boiling water over the petals and let them steep for about 15 to 20 minutes. As the petals steep, the water will take on a lovely pale pink or lavender hue and begin to smell incredibly fragrant. After steeping, strain out the petals, reserving the liquid.
Prepare the Jelly Base: Pour the strained peony tea into a large pot or jam pot. Add 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. The acidity from the lemon juice helps balance the sweetness of the sugar and also ensures the jelly will set properly.
Add Pectin and Boil: Sprinkle in the powdered pectin and stir until it's fully dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil, and allow it to boil for 1 minute. It’s important not to add the sugar just yet—only the pectin at this stage.
Add Sugar: Once the pectin has dissolved and the liquid is boiling, stir in 4 cups of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. If you’re using a ""low-sugar"" pectin, you can reduce the sugar to as little as 1/2 to 1 cup, depending on your preference. The amount of sugar you use will affect both the sweetness and the texture of the jelly, so adjust to your taste.
Final Boil: Bring the mixture back to a full, rolling boil and let it cook for 1 more minute. This final boil ensures the jelly thickens properly and reaches the right consistency.
Jar the Jelly: After the final boil, remove the pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the hot jelly into sterilized canning jars, leaving about 1/4 inch of headspace at the top of each jar. Wipe the rims clean before sealing with the jar lids.
Canning (Optional): Before you begin, make sure you have a water bath canner, clean jars, and new canning lids. You’ll need enough water in the canner to cover the jars by at least 1 inch.

Choose blossoms that are vibrant and free of pesticides. You’ll need about 2 to 4 cups of flowers, depending on their size. Gently pull the flowers off the stems, ensuring you only use the petals, as the stems and green parts can be bitter.
Steep the Flowers: Place the grape hyacinth petals in a heatproof jar or bowl. Pour 4 cups of boiling water over the flowers and let them steep for 15 to 20 minutes. The water will transform into a lovely, deep purple color, and the fragrance of the grape hyacinths will infuse the liquid. Once the steeping time is up, strain out the petals, leaving you with the fragrant purple tea.
Prepare the Jelly Base: Pour the strained grape hyacinth tea into a large pot. Add the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. The acidity of the lemon juice helps balance the sweetness of the sugar and ensures the jelly sets properly.
Add Pectin and Boil: Stir in the powdered pectin and bring the mixture to a boil. Let it boil for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Make sure the pectin is fully dissolved before proceeding. This step is crucial because the pectin helps the jelly to set properly.
Add Sugar: Once the pectin has dissolved and the mixture is boiling, stir in the sugar. Use the standard 1:1 ratio of sugar to liquid for a traditional jelly, which means you’ll need 4 cups of sugar for every 4 cups of grape hyacinth tea. If you prefer a less sweet jelly, consider using a low-sugar pectin and reducing the sugar to 1/2 to 1 cup. Stir the sugar until it’s completely dissolved.

You can leave the skins on if you prefer, but for traditional fries, it’s best to peel them.Once peeled, cut the potatoes into uniform, fry-shaped strips. Aim for fries about ½ to ¾ inch wide. This size works best for canning and gives you that perfect fry texture after canning and cooking.
Soak the Potatoes: To ensure the best texture, soaking the potatoes in water helps to remove excess starch. Place your cut potatoes in a large bowl, and cover them with water.Change the water three times, allowing each water change to soak for about an hour. You can also soak them overnight for the best results.After the final soak, drain the fries well, and give them a quick rinse in cold water to remove any remaining starch.
Pack the Jars: Sterilize your canning jars by running them through the dishwasher or placing them in hot water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart jar or ½ teaspoon per pint jar.Begin packing the raw fries into the jars. The fries should be packed firmly but not squished. Leave about 1-inch of headspace at the top of the jar. Make sure that the fries are upright to fit as many as possible.
Fill with Boiling Water: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully pour the boiling water into the jars over the fries, ensuring the fries are completely submerged. Leave the 1-inch headspace as required.Use a spatula or a non-metallic utensil to remove any air bubbles by gently running it along the inside of the jar. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean towel to ensure a good seal.
Pressure Can the French Fries: Place your jars in the pressure canner. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your pressure canner to ensure safety and proper processing times.Process the jars at 10 pounds of pressure for 35 minutes for pint jars or 40 minutes for quart jars, adjusting pressure to altitude (see notes).After the processing time is up, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or brush it sparingly with unflavored oil.
Heat the sugar over moderate heat until the edges begin to melt. Use a heatproof utensil to gently stir the liquefied sugar from the bottom and edges towards the center, stirring, until all the sugar is dissolved. (Or most of it—there may be some lumps, which will melt later.) Continue to cook stirring infrequently until the caramel starts smoking and begins to smell like it’s just about to burn. It won’t take long.
Without hesitation, sprinkle in the ¾ teaspoon salt without stirring, then pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet and lift up the baking sheet immediately, tilting and swirling it almost vertically to encourage the caramel to form as thin a layer as possible. Set aside to harden and cool.
To make the ice cream, make an ice bath by filling a large bowl about a third full with ice cubes and adding a cup or so of water so they’re floating. Nest a smaller metal bowl (at least 2 quarts/liters) over the ice, pour 1 cup (250ml) of the milk into the inner bowl, and rest a mesh strainer on top of it.Warm the cream in a small saucepan or microwave oven and set aside.
Spread the 1 1/4 cup (250g) sugar in a large saucepan, with a capacity of at least 4qts/4l, in an even layer. Cook over moderate heat, until caramelized, using the same method described in Step #2.
Once caramelized, remove from heat and stir in the butter and salt, until butter is melted, then gradually whisk in the warm cream, about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring as you go. The caramel may harden and seize, but stirring it over low heat should encourage those bits to melt. (A few bits may be stubborn, which will dissolve or can be strained out later.) Stir in the remaining 1 cup (250ml) of the milk.
Whisk the yolks in a small bowl and gradually pour some of the warm caramel mixture over the yolks, stirring constantly. Scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan and cook the custard using a heatproof utensil, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens. If using an instant-read thermometer, it should read 160-170ºF (71-77ºC).
Pour the custard through the strainer into the milk set over the ice bath, add the vanilla, then stir frequently until the mixture is cooled down. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or until thoroughly chilled.
Freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
While the ice cream is churning, crumble the hardened caramel praline into very little bits, about the size of very large confetti (about ½-inch, 1 cm).

In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3/4 cup (105g) of flour, baking powder, and salt.
Once the almond paste is completely broken up, add the cubes of butter and the vanilla and almond extracts, then process until the batter is very smooth and fluffy.
Add the eggs one at a time, processing a bit before the next addition. (You may wish to open the machine and scrape the sides down to make sure the eggs are getting fully incorporated.) After you add all the eggs, the mixture may look curdled. Don’t worry; it’ll come back together after the next step.
Add half the flour mixture and pulse the machine a few times, then add the rest, pulsing the machine until the dry ingredients are just incorporated, but do not overmix. (You can also transfer the batter to a bowl and mix the dry ingredients in, which ensures the dry ingredients get incorporated evenly and you don’t overbeat it.)
Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake the cake for 45-60 minutes, or until the top is deep brown and feels set when you press in the center.
Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp or serrated knife around the perimeter, loosing the cake from the sides of the pan. Let the cake cool completely in the pan.
Once cool, tap the cake out of the pan, remove the parchment paper, and set on a cake plate until ready to serve. (Tip: Warm the bottom of the cake pan directly on the stovetop for just a few seconds, which will help the cake release.)",en,True,"[""European"", ""Western"", ""French""]",False,True,

Start by preparing the short ribs. Pat the short ribs dry with paper towel and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of avocado oil in a medium Dutch oven or sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add the short ribs and brown the meat on all sides (this should take about 10 minutes). Once browned, transfer the short ribs to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining tablespoon of avocado oil. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and cook for about 3 minutes or until the onion is soft and translucent. (Be careful not to burn the garlic! Keep things moving around the pan and lower the heat if necessary.) Add the paprika and cook for 1 minute just to toast the spice. Stir in the tomato paste, chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, honey, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, and 1½ cups of the beef broth. Bring to a boil then lower to a simmer and add the short ribs. Cover the pan with a lid and transfer to the oven and cook for 1 hour. Turn the short ribs over and cook for 1 hour more until the short ribs are very tender and easy to break down with a fork. (If the short ribs aren’t tender after 2 hours, allow them to cook for another 15 to 30 minutes.)
Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the doctored refried beans in a bowl. Cover and set aside.
Make the cherry tomato pico de gallo. Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and extra lime juice to taste. Cover and set aside. (Feel free to refrigerate the pico if you’d like.)
Moving on to the guacamole! Cut each avocado in half lengthwise and remove the pit.Scoop the flesh into a small bowl. Immediately add the lemon and lime juice, and a pinch of salt and mash with a fork until relatively smooth. Stir in the cilantro and onion and season with extra salt and black pepper to taste. Press plastic wrap onto the surface until ready to use.
When the short ribs are tender, transfer the short ribs to a cutting board and shred the meat with two forks. I like to leave some larger chunks intact, but you do you. Return the shredded meat to the sauce. (The sauce should be quite thick—a true BBQ sauce consistency—but if it seems very thin, simmer for 5-10 minutes, uncovered, to thicken it up a bit.)
Increase the oven temperature to 375° F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment for easy cleanup.
Nacho assembly time! Arrange the tortilla chips in an even layer on the baking sheet. Dollop the baked beans all over the chips. (You can leave them as dollops or spread them out a bit.) Sprinkle half the cheese over the chips. Add the warm BBQ short ribs in a relatively even layer and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
Bake for about 8 to 12 minutes or until the cheese is fully melted. (Keep an eye on it!)

Combine
Stir in the mashed banana, oat flour and baking powder. Add the chocolate chips, if desired. If the pancake mixture seems too thick you can add almond milk to thin it out a bit (add 1 T at a time).
Cook
Spray a medium sized non-stick pan with cooking spray and set heat to low-medium (I use the number 3 on my stove). The lower heat is the key to making sure the pancakes don't burn. Pour in pancake batter (I use ¼ cup for each) and cook until little bubbles form (about 3-5 minutes).
Flip
Make sure the pancakes have set enough before you try flipping them, or else you’ll end up with a scramble. Carefully flip the pancakes over to the other side. Cook until pancakes are done in the middle (typically takes another 2-3 minutes).
Serve
Place pancakes on a plate, top with your favorite pancake toppings. I like these with a drizzle of maple syrup, peanut butter and extra chocolate chips. Makes 4-5 pancakes.
