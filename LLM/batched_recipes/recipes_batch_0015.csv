For the crumble topping In a bowl combine the flour, oats, dark brown sugar, chopped ginger, salt, and cinnamon. Give it a quick stir. Pour over the melted butter and stir until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Place the bowl in the fridge while you work on the fruit.
For the peaches Slice peaches and place them in a large bowl. If you want to remove the skins see the notes below. To the peaches, add the sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and amaretto. Stir to combine. Next add the salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cornstarch. Stir well to distribute the dry mixture evenly.
Assembly Place peaches in a shallow 2.5-3 qt baking dish. You can also use a dutch oven or even a cast iron pan of similar size. Top the peaches evenly with the crumble topping. If you’re using a shallow pan then place it on a baking sheet to catch any spills. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and the crumble is nice and golden. Serve with your favorite ice cream. Leftovers can be reheated in the oven.
Notes To get the skins off peaches: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place peaches in boiling water for about 30 seconds. Make sure not to crowd the pot, depending on your pot you may only be able to do a few at a time. Remove peaches with a slotted spoon and place in an ice bath. Leave them in the ice bath for a few seconds. Then take the peaches out and use your finger to remove the peel.",en,True,,False,True

Sift the flour and 6 ½ tablespoons powdered sugar, almond flour (or meal), and salt into the bowl, then whisk to combine.
Place the butter in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream on medium speed until it becomes the consistency of mayonnaise. Sift in the remaining powdered sugar and vanilla. Mix on low to combine and then increase to medium and mix about 1 minute, until the mixture gets a little fluffy (scrape down sides if necessary).
Add the dry ingredients to the butter mix in 2 additions, mixing about 30 seconds after each addition. Scrape the bottom of the bowl, mixing in any dry ingredients. Add the egg and mix on low just until combined. Use a scraper to mix and make sure everything is incorporated. Divide dough into two round logs or bricks, double wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for at least 2 hours. Dough can be frozen up to 1 month.
When ready to use, remove one package of the dough and cut into 6 equal portions. Lightly dust your work surface (I love this mat) and roll each piece, one at a time, into a circle-ish about 5 ½ to 6 inches in diameter that will overlap the tart pans. If you like a thick crust, roll the dough 5 to 5 ½ inches in diameter. Place in your tart pans, gently pressing in and up the sides. Run your rolling pin across the tart pan to cut the overhanging crust off. If you’d like a taller crust, use a sharp knife to cut the crust 1-2 millimeters above the tart pan. I put all the crust remains on the cookie sheet I bake the tarts on. My kids gobble them up. Gently shape the tops. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes (or freezer for 10) and preheat your oven to 325 degrees.
Remove tarts from the fridge and poke light holes in each tart shell with a fork. I don’t blind bake these shells as they don’t shrink or puff up very much, but you are welcome to! Place 6 tarts (and the crust remains) on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush egg wash on each tart shell gently with a pastry brush. This step will seal your crust, keeping it dry when you fill them. Return to the oven and bake about 10 more minutes, but keep a close eye on them–you’re looking for a nice golden brown. It will depend on how thin you rolled your pastry and ovens vary. Let them cool for 5 minutes before removing from the tart pans.
For the lemon cream: Heat 2 inches of water in a medium saucepan to simmering, not boiling. Combine lemon juice, eggs, egg yolk, sugar, and salt in a stainless-steel bowl (I use my kitchen-aid mixing bowl). Whisk to combine and place bowl on pan of simmering water-making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Whisk the mixture constantly to avoid the sugar and egg reacting. When it becomes very thick and registers 180 degrees (this will take about 10 minutes), remove from the heat and let cool to 140 degrees, stirring from time to time.
Cut the butter into 1 tablespoon pieces. For this next step you can put the lemon cream in your blender or keep it in your mixing bowl and use an immersion blender. Add 1 piece of butter at a time and mix after each addition until incorporated. It will become pale and thick-and delicious. Keeps in an airtight container in the fridge for 5 days. You can use straight from the fridge or gently heat and soften in a stainless steel bowl set over simmering water.
To assemble the tarts: Distribute the lemon cream between each sweet pastry shell and smooth the tops. I have found it easiest to put the lemon cream in a pitcher and pour into the pastry shells. Let sit for an hour or refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Melt the white chocolate and coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl in two 30-second increments, stirring after each interval.

Brown Butter Blondies,"['1 cup Butter', '1-½ cup Brown Sugar', '4 teaspoons Vanilla (not A Typo!)', '2 whole Eggs', '2 cups All-purpose Flour', '1 teaspoon Kosher Salt', '1-½ cup Chocolate Chips Or Chunks']",,"Brown the butter. Place the butter in a skillet over medium heat. The butter will melt, then foam, then start to brown on the bottom. This process will take about 10 minutes. Once the butter foams, stir nearly continuously to allow the butter to brown but not burn. When most of the foam is gone and the milk solids are very brown on the bottom of the skillet, turn the heat off, transfer the browned butter to a large bowl, and let cool for 10-15 minutes until warm but not hot.
When ready to proceed, preheat the oven the 350F and line a square baking pan (8×8 or 9×9) with parchment paper or cooking spray.
Returning to the cooled brown butter, add the brown sugar, vanilla, and eggs to the bowl. Stir well to incorporate the sugar and eggs with the butter.
Add the flour and salt and stir until very smooth. The batter will be caramel colored and should be glossy. Stir in the chocolate chips and transfer to the baking dish.
Bake the blondies for 25-30 minutes until the edges start to pull away from the edges and the center is barely set. We are going for gooey here.
Remove from the oven and let the blondies cool completely in the pan. Cut into small squares, serve, congratulate yourself, decide whether or not you feel like sharing. Enjoy!
Notes: • You can brown the butter slightly longer in advance and let it cool completely for a more “chocolate chips inside a blondie” effect. Making the batter while the butter is still warm melts some of the chocolate chips, resulting in a swirled effect, which I love. Both methods are delicious!
• I use salted butter when making this recipe. If you have unsalted butter, add a few more pinches of salt to the batter. It’s needed to balance the sweetness of the sugar and chocolate chips.

Place your bread into the oven, and reduce the temperature from 500 to 400 F. Bake for 40 minutes, covered. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.
To make sure that the bread is completely cooked through, take its temperature. Carefully tip the bread onto its side and insert a thermometer into the bottom. It should read 200-205 F. If not, place it back into the oven until it is ready (extra time in bread baking is a good thing). If you’re worried about the top getting too brown, put the lid back on.
When your bread is ready, transfer to a wire rack to cool. It should feel light and make a hollow sound when you give it a knock underneath. Let it cool for at least 1 hour. Cutting it too soon might ruin the texture resulting in a gummy crumb!",en,True,,True,True
how to make brioche rolls,"['1 1/4 c. warm milk', '2 teaspoons active dry yeast', '2½ tablespoons sugar', '3 large eggs, divided', '3 1/3 cups bread flour', '1½ teaspoons salt', '2½ tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for coating the pan']",,"Preparing the dough:
In a large glass measuring cup, add the milk, yeast, and sugar. Whisk well. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Then, add 2 of the eggs and whisk to combine.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, salt and butter. Using the paddle attachment, mix until the butter blends into the flour. You don’t want large chunks.
On low speed, add the milk & yeast mixture to the bowl. Once combined, increase the speed (I use #2 or #3 on my Kitchen Aid) until a dough forms, about 5-8 minutes. It will not come together into a ball; the dough will be smooth, elastic, but still wet or sticky resembling thick ‘batter.’ Once fully risen, it will be easier to handle. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula.
Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm spot until it has doubled in size, 1- 3 hours* (see note below). Alternatively, refer to the baking schedules outlined in the post above.
Cutting, Shaping & Assembly:
Preheat your oven to 400 F. Generously coat a 9″ cake pan with butter. Set aside.
Tip your fully risen dough onto a lightly floured work surface. It should feel slightly wet and sticky.
Using a floured bench scraper (large knife or pizza wheel) cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Take two pieces of the dough and cut them in half, creating 4 smaller pieces. These smaller pieces will fill the center of your brioche (think: center of a sunflower). You now have 12 pieces in total.
To shape into balls, gently flatten each piece of dough. Pull up the sides tucking them in towards the center. Flip the ball over (seam side down) and move to an un-floured part of your work surface (it’s easier to roll this way). Place your palm over the top and gently roll into a smooth ball. If your dough is too sticky, sprinkle with a little bit of flour for easier handling.
To assemble the brioche, to the coated pan, place 1 ball of dough at 12 o’clock, 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock and 9 o’clock. Fill in the gaps with the remaining dough, placing the 4 smaller balls (you made earlier) in the center. Doing it this way will ensure that the dough is evenly spaced.
With the remaining egg, beat together with a splash of water. This is your egg wash.
Brush the dough with your mixture. If you don’t have a pastry brush, use a folded napkin or paper towel instead.
Loosely cover the pan with a kitchen towel. Rest for about 30 minutes. Your dough should look slightly puffed, relaxed, and no longer dense. Adjust the time here, if necessary.
To Finish:
Bake 400 F. for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.

Remove the fully risen dough onto a lightly floured work surface. It should feel slightly wet and sticky.
Using a floured bench scraper (large knife or pizza wheel) cut the dough into thirds.
To shape into balls, gently flatten each piece of dough. Pull up the sides tucking them in towards the center. If your dough is too sticky to shape, sprinkle a little bit of flour over the top for easier handling. Flip the ball over (seam side down) and move to an un-floured part of your work surface (it’s easier to roll this way). Cup the dough with your hands and gently roll into a smooth ball.
To assemble, add one ball at a time to your prepared pan (it’s like building a snowman). Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise about 1 1 /2 inches above the rim of the pan, about 30 minutes- 1 hour (or more). The amount of time will depend on the ambient temperature.
If using an egg wash, beat together the remaining egg with a splash of water. Brush the dough with your mixture. If you don’t have a pastry brush, use a folded napkin or paper towel instead.

When finished, cool in the tin for about 10 minutes or so. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1-2 hours. Then, cut into slices. A large serrated bread knife is best for this.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using a bench knife (or chef’s knife), divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. If you have a kitchen scale, weigh each piece to guarantee that they’re all the same size.
To shape the dough into balls, gently flatten each piece like a pancake. Pull up each side pinching it together in the center. Repeat until the ball is sealed.
