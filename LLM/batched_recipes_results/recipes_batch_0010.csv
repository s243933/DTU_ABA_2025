Gather all the ingredients.
To Marinate the Chicken
Prepare 1½ lb boneless, skin-on chicken thighs by cutting each into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Season with ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
Now, grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure ½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice). Add it to a large bowl. Mince or press 1 clove garlic (I use a garlic press) and add it to the bowl.
Add ½–1 Tbsp soy sauce, ½ Tbsp sake, and ½ tsp toasted sesame oil to the ginger and garlic. Whisk to combine.
Add the chicken to the marinade and mix it with your hands. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
To Preheat the Oil
While the chicken is marinating, prepare the oil for deep-frying. Pour about 3–4 cups neutral oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (I like using the 2.75-QT Staub), until you have at least 1 to 1½ inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) of oil. Heat it to 325ºF (160ºC) over medium-low heat so you have enough time to prep the chicken.
To Coat the Chicken
Meanwhile, dredge the chicken pieces. Prepare separate piles of 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch in a tray. Lightly coat a piece of marinated chicken in the flour and dust off the excess.
Next, dredge it in the potato starch and shake off the excess. Place it in a separate tray. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.
To Cook: The First Fry
Check that the oil temperature has reached 325ºF (160ºC). Tip: If you don‘t have an instant read thermometer, insert a wooden chopstick into the oil; you‘ll know it‘s hot enough if small bubbles start to appear around the tip. For more helpful tips, see my post How to Deep-Fry Food.When it's ready, gently add 3 to 5 chicken pieces at a time to the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pot. Tip: If you add too many pieces at once, the oil temperature will drop quickly, and the chicken will absorb too much oil.
Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is a light golden color. Transfer to a wire rack to drain the excess oil. Tip: If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat setting. Controlling the oil temperature at all times is very important for deep-frying.
The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken as it rests. Continue to fry the remaining chicken pieces. Between batches, scoop up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.
The Second Fry
Now, raise the oil temperature to 350ºF (180ºC). Place the first 3 to 5 pieces of rested chicken back into the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to the wire rack to drain the excess oil. Continue frying the remaining chicken pieces.
The left photo shows the chicken pieces after the first fry and the right photo shows them after the second fry. The chicken pieces on the right are slightly darker in color.
To Serve
Serve the chicken hot with lemon wedges and a dipping plate of Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise. You can also sprinkle shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) on the mayo for a bit of spice, if desired.

Gather all the ingredients.
To Boil the Potatoes
Wash 2 lb russet potatoes under cold running water. Peel them and remove the eyes. Cut each potato into 4 equal pieces so they cook evenly. Nami's Tip: I use russets for their starchy, fluffy, and light texture. They are the best variety for soaking up the juices and flavor from the meat and onion.
Put the cold running water and potatoes in a large pot and cover with a lid slightly ajar to prevent boiling over. Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a boil; this will take about 15 minutes. Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle boil and cook until done, about 15–20 minutes. You have 30 minutes to complete the next step!
To Cook the Onions and Meat
Meanwhile, prepare the onion and ground beef. Mince 1 onion finely (called mijingiri in Japanese). Lay an onion half on the cutting board, flat side down. Make ¼-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. Then, make ¼-inch horizontal slices, again keeping the root intact.
Make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices. If you need to chop the onions finer, run your knife through them using a rocking motion while holding down the tip of the knife.
Preheat a large skillet on medium heat. Once it's hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and the minced onions. Spread the onions and let them cook undisturbed for a while to develop a nice char—just be careful not to burn them.
Sauté until translucent and tender, about 12–15 minutes. Add 1 lb ground beef to the pan and break it up with a wooden spoon. Nami's Tip: Be sure to evaporate any moisture from the onions; excess liquid can make the croquettes soggy.
Season with ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Stir and cook until the meat is no longer pink. Turn off the heat and set aside until the potatoes are done cooking.
To Combine the Potatoes and Meat
To check if the potatoes are cooked, insert a skewer into a bigger piece; it's done if it pierces easily. Remove from the heat. Hold the lid slightly ajar to keep the potatoes in, and carefully drain off all the water.
Move the pot back to the stove over low heat. Continuously shake the pot to evaporate the remaining moisture from the potatoes, about 1–2 minutes. The potatoes should look powdery and dry. Transfer them to a large bowl.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher while they are still hot, allowing the steam to escape. Keep some potato chunks for texture. Then, add 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper and combine gently.
If the meat mixture has released excess liquid, tilt the pan to collect it on one side and avoid adding it to the potatoes. Add the drained meat to the bowl of potatoes and gently mix to combine.
To Make the Patties
While the mixture is still warm (but not hot), form oval-shaped patties 3 inches (7.5 cm) in length. Try not to create air pockets that can make the patties explode while deep-frying.
Place the patties on a tray or plate to let cool completely. Once cool to room temperature, cover and rest them in the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes. Do not skip this step! Nami's Tip: Chilling the patties helps the ingredients meld and prevents the croquettes from bursting during frying. Warm patties generate steam as they heat up, which can rupture the panko coating and cause them to explode. Cold patties, on the other hand, minimize steam and stay intact.
To Bread the Croquettes
Prepare separate trays for ½ cup all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs). Crack 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into a small bowl and beat with a whisk.
Dredge each patty in flour and shake off the excess. Dip in the beaten egg, then coat with the panko. , pressing to adhere the breadcrumbs.
Gently press the croquettes to help the breadcrumbs adhere and adjust the shape as needed.
To Deep-Fry
Add 4 cups neutral oil to a medium pot and bring it to 340–350ºF (170–180ºC) over medium heat. Use a cooking thermometer to check the oil temperature so there‘s no guessing. Nami's Tip: Make sure there‘s at least 2 inches (5 cm) of oil in the pot so the croquettes are completely submerged while cooking. Once you get used to deep-frying, you can use the chopstick or panko tricks to determine if the oil is ready.
Deep-fry 2–3 croquettes at a time until golden brown, about 2–3 minutes. Do not touch or flip the croquettes until one side is golden brown. The inside is already cooked, so you just need to fry the breading. Nami's Tip: Do not crowd the pot as the oil temperature will drop quickly and cause the food to absorb more oil.
Transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. Continue deep-frying the rest of the patties.
To Serve
Serve with tonkatsu sauce (bottled or Homemade Tonkatsu Sauce). In Japan, we typically serve deep-fried foods with shredded green cabbage. I shred it with a julienne slicer or stainless steel cabbage slicer and serve it with Japanese Sesame Dressing. I also add a few wedges of tomato for color.
To Store
Store the leftovers in an airtight container and freeze up to a month. To reheat, put the defrosted or frozen croquettes on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper.

Cut 4 oz sliced pork belly into bite-sized pieces, about 2 inches (5 cm).
Cut 2 green onions/scallions into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Cut the thick white parts in half lengthwise.
Cut 2 Japanese or Chinese eggplants in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.
Cut each piece in half lengthwise. Soak the eggplant wedges in a bowl of water until you're ready to cook, then drain well. Tip: Soaking the eggplant helps to remove the astringency and prevent the color from changing.
Meanwhile, crush 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press). Cut off the tops of 1–2 dried red chili pepper and remove the seeds. Then, cut the chili into small pieces. I slice up one chili and leave the other whole for garnish. Tip: You can leave in the seeds and/or chop the second chili pepper if you prefer more heat.
To mix the seasoning, combine 1 Tbsp oyster sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp soy sauce in a small bowl. Stir to combine.
To Cook
Heat a wok, frying pan, or saucepan (I used my All-Clad 2-QT Copper Core Saucepan) over medium heat. When it's hot, add half the sesame oil (2 tsp). Then, add the pork belly and season it with ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper and ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.
Stir-fry the pork until it's no longer pink, then remove it to a plate or tray (I use a stainless prep tray).
Add a little more sesame oil (1 tsp) to the pan. Then, add the well-drained eggplants.
Stir-fry until they soften a bit and develop some color. They will absorb all the oil left in the pan. The eggplant does need some oil to sauté nicely, so add more sesame oil if the eggplant looks dry and sticks to the pan.
Add the cooked pork belly back into the pan and toss quickly with the eggplant.
Add the green onion and toss. Then, add the garlic and red chili pepper and toss until aromatic. Try not to burn them.
Pour in the seasoning and stir quickly to coat the ingredients. Tip: Since I used a stainless steel saucepan (not nonstick), I add a little bit of water to the pot to help loosen the ingredients from the cooking surface. This small amount of water will evaporate quickly as you finish stir-frying.
To Serve

I strongly encourage you to use a kitchen scale to weigh the flours. Prepare 24 squares of parchment paper measuring 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 cm). I DO NOT double or triple this recipe. Make in batches, if needed.
Melt 6 Tbsp unsalted butter in the microwave or in a saucepan on the stove and let it cool slightly. Crack 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) in a bowl and beat them with a whisk. Set aside.
Combine 1 cup whole milk (110ºF or 43ºC—slightly warmer than body temperature) and 1 tsp instant yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer (or large mixing bowl). Then, take ½ tsp sugar from the ¼ cup granulated sugar you measured earlier and add it to the milk and yeast. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside for 5–10 minutes. Note: If you wonder why I hydrated the instant yeast, please read the post.
Sift 320 g tapioca flour (2½ cups + 2½ Tbsp) and 180 g all-purpose flour (plain flour) (1¼ cups + 1 Tbsp) through a fine-mesh sieve into another large mixing bowl. Whisk to combine and set aside.
To Mix the Ingredients
Fit the stand mixer with a flat beater attachment. Add the rest of the sugar and the beaten egg to the milk mixture.
Add the melted butter and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract to the milk mixture.
Stir on low speed (Speed 2 on my KitchenAid Professional HD stand mixer) for 1 minute to combine. You could also stir it with a wooden spoon.
Add roughly 2 cups of the flour mixture and stir on low speed (Speed 2) until well combined.
Keep the stand mixer running on low speed and add ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and the remaining flour mixture, one scoop at a time. The dough mixture will thicken. Set aside the mixing bowl that the flour was in for the next step (you‘ll put the dough in it).
To Knead the Dough
Now, knead the dough at medium-high speed (Speed 6) for 3–4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. This is a wet and sticky dough, so do not add more flour. Tip: Kneading develops the structure of the dough by folding and stretching the gluten strands. Hand Kneading: Knead by hand for 5–6 minutes. It’s hard to knead this wet dough by hand. You can add 1–2 tablespoons of flour if it’s too wet to handle, but do not add any more than that.
While the mixer is kneading the dough, add a little oil to the large mixing bowl that held the flour mixture and grease it with a paper towel.
Stop the mixer after 3–4 minutes or when the dough is smooth. It should be sticky and stretchy when you remove the flat beater from the mixer.
To Proof the Dough (Bulk Fermentation)
Scrape down the dough from the sides of the bowl with a dough scraper or pastry card. Collect it into one big mass, then gently transfer it to the greased bowl. The key is to make a smooth surface on the dough so that it rises well. Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or a clean shower cap) and place it in a warm environment to rise until doubled, about 70–80 minutes. I use the Proof setting of my oven at 100ºF (38ºC). I place a bowl of warm/hot water inside the oven, but away from the dough, to keep the environment moist. Tip: Make sure the proof temperature is not too high. If the dough gets too warm, it will ferment too quickly (or overferment) and impair the flavor.
After 70–80 minutes, pour 4 cups safflower oil into a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot (see Notes for how much oil to use). Set up a cooking thermometer, if you have one. Set the alarm to a low of 325ºF (168ºC) and a high of 350ºF (177ºC). Tip: I use ThermoWork’s ChefAlarm. A clip attaches the probe to the side of the Dutch oven, holding it securely in place.
In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups confectioners’ sugar, ¼ cup whole milk, and ½ tsp pure vanilla extract. Whisk it really well until there are no lumps of powdered sugar. Keep the matcha powder to the side for now.
The image shows that the dough has doubled in size after 75 minutes of proofing.
To Roll the Dough Balls
Prepare 1–2 Tbsp of all-purpose flour and put it at the corner of your work surface. Lightly flour the work surface and your hands.
Transfer the dough with the dough scraper to the lightly floured surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough and press it down with your hands to release any air bubbles.
Use the dough scraper to form the dough into a rough log shape. Cut the log into two equal pieces.
Set one piece of dough on your work surface. Shape the other piece into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Cut the piece on your work surface into quarters and roll them into balls. Work with one dough ball at a time, and keep the other balls under plastic wrap so they don‘t dry out.
Each dough ball will make roughly 3 Pon de Ring donuts. Using the dough scraper, cut the first dough ball into 24 small balls. Each ball should be ½–¾ inch (1.5 cm) in diameter and weigh 5 grams.
Roll each ball between your hands, but try not to spend too much time. Overkneaded dough often results in a hard crust and a dense, dry interior. Since the dough is very sticky, the dough scraper is very helpful for picking up each piece of dough.
To Form the Donut Rings
Now, form the donuts. You will need 8 balls to make each Pon de Ring donut. Use the dough scraper to transfer one ball at a time to a parchment square, forming a ring as you go. Make sure the balls are connected.
Each Pon de Ring should weigh about 40 grams (8 balls at 5 g each).
Continue forming the rest of the donut rings.
Dab a bit of water with a pastry brush where each ball attaches to the neighboring one. This will keep the balls from separating in the hot oil. Cover the donuts with a damp paper towel or light cloth (make sure it’s not heavy) and let them rest to proof for 15–20 minutes. Tip: If you are taking a long time, it’s very helpful to work with a partner or keep the donuts in the refrigerator to slow down the proofing so the dough doesn't overproof.
To Fry
When you’re finishing up with the last batch of dough, start heating the oil in the Dutch oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Line one baking sheet with a paper towel. Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper and put a wire rack on top.
Pick up one parchment square with a donut ring on top. Using your hand or fine-mesh skimmer (the kind that has a flat mesh), carefully place the donut with the parchment paper into the hot oil.
Let go of the donut and paper and set a timer for 1 minute 15 seconds for the first side. Tip: Only add enough donuts for a 5–10 degree drop in temperature. I only fry 2 donuts at a time. If the oil cools down too much, the donuts won’t fry properly.
When the timer beeps, flip the donuts quickly using chopsticks or tongs. Fry the second side for 45 seconds; set a timer. Using tongs or chopsticks, carefully remove the parchment square from the donut and discard.
When the 45-second timer beeps, scoop up the donuts with the skimmer or tongs and drain the oil well. Then, transfer to the paper towel to drain any extra oil. Glaze the donuts while you continue frying the remaining donuts (see the next step).
To Glaze
While the donuts are still hot, dip each one into the glaze, making sure to coat both sides well. Tip: Don't wait until you fry all the donuts. Deep-frying and glazing at the same time gets hectic, so find a partner for this step.
Place the glazed donuts onto the prepared rack to allow the excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set and harden on the donuts after 30 minutes.
After glazing 12 donuts, you can add 1 Tbsp matcha green tea powder to the leftover glaze. Whisk really well to combine.
Dip the other donuts into the matcha glaze. Place them onto the rack to allow the excess glaze to drip down. The glaze will set after 30 minutes.
To Serve
Just like any other deep-fried food, it’s best to eat the donuts while they are warm. Enjoy!

To Prepare the Ingredients
Peel 3.5 oz daikon radish and cut it lengthwise in quarters.
Thinly slice the daikon crosswise.
Strip the leaves off the tough stems of 2 oz kale. Coarsely chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces.
To Cook
Add the daikon, 3 cups water, and 2 dashi packets to a medium saucepan. Cover with a lid and bring it to a boil on medium heat.
Once the water is boiling, shake the dashi packets with cooking chopsticks to release more flavor. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, covered, for 2–3 minutes. Discard the packets.
Add the kale leaves to the pot and stir it all together. Cover and simmer until the daikon and kale are tender, about 5 minutes.
I used my finger to check that they're cooked, but you can also pierce a piece of daikon with a bamboo skewer to make sure it goes through easily. The daikon should appear translucent, and the kale should be wilted. When both are perfectly tender, turn off the heat.
To Add the Miso and Wakame
With heat turned off, add 3 Tbsp miso to a ladleful of hot stock. Mix with chopsticks to dissolve it completely, then stir it into the broth. I use a miso muddler to measure and dissolve the paste; you can also use a fine-mesh miso strainer instead of a ladle. Now, taste the soup and add more miso, if needed. If it‘s too salty, dilute it with more water or dashi, if you have any. I added another 1 Tbsp miso since the particular miso I used has a mild flavor.
Add 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed to the soup and stir to combine and rehydrate. We add wakame to the soup right before serving to keep its fresh aroma and color. Tip: If you worry about salt intake, I recommend rehydrating the dried wakame in a separate bowl of water first to get rid of the saltiness.
Serve immediately in individual bowls and enjoy. Place on the right side of the table setting; you can read about how to serve it at the table in my post Ichiju Sansai (One Soup Three Dishes).

To Prepare the Stock
Fill 1 large donabe clay pot (or Dutch oven or any heavy-bottomed pot) two-thirds full of water. Add 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) and soak for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. The right image shows the kombu dashi after 30 minutes. Note: Use 1 piece of kombu per large donabe. If you‘re doubling this recipe, use two donabe and put 1 piece of kombu in each pot.
To Prepare the Hot Pot Ingredients
Prepare the udon noodles according to the package instructions. I use 1 serving udon noodles (still frozen) and reheat it in boiling water for 1 minute. Transfer them to iced water to stop the cooking, then drain well. Place on a plate and set aside. The meal ends with the udon course after you‘ve eaten the main meal.

Diagonally cut only the white part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) into pieces ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick. Tip: Reserve the green part for another use, like making Homemade Chashu.
Rinse 1 package enoki mushrooms and 1 package shimeji mushrooms. Discard the root ends of both mushrooms and separate them into smaller chunks.
Cut off the stems of 4 shiitake mushrooms. Optionally, cut a decorative flower pattern on the caps (see How to Cut Shiitake Hanagiri).
Cut 2 inches carrot into ¼-inch rounds. Optionally, you can use a vegetable cutter to cut the carrots into a flower shape.
Cut 1 package medium-firm tofu (momen dofu) into square pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
Arrange all the vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu on a serving platter.
To Prepare the Garnishes and Beef
Peel 2 inches daikon radish and grate it (I use a ceramic grater). Squeeze it gently to remove most of the liquid and put the grated daikon in a small bowl.
Cut 2 green onions/scallions into thin rounds and put it in a bowl.
Prepare optional shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) in a bowl. Lay the 1 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) on a platter.
To Cook the Shabu Shabu
Set up a portable gas stove at the table and put the donabe on the burner. Place the platters with the ingredients on the table. Give each person their own bowls of ponzu and sesame dipping sauce. I also prepare a shallow bowl for each diner to cool their food.
Bring the broth to a simmer over medium heat. Take out the kombu right before water starts to boil (otherwise, the water will get slimy).
Add the tofu, tough parts of napa cabbage and shungiku, negi, carrots, and some mushrooms. Reserve the softer, leafy vegetables to cook later. You don’t have to put all the ingredients in at once; cook in batches, if you prefer. Cover to cook for 10 minutes.
To Eat the Shabu Shabu
While you’re waiting for the food to cook, prepare your dipping sauces. Add the grated daikon, shichimi togarashi, and green onion to the ponzu. Add the green onion to the sesame sauce.
When you‘re ready to eat the meat, pick up a piece of thinly sliced beef with a set of communal cooking chopsticks. Stir or “swish“ the meat in the boiling broth and cook for 20–30 seconds or until the meat is no longer pink; be careful not to overcook it.
Serve the beef, vegetables, mushrooms, and tofu once cooked and enjoy the food dipped in ponzu or sesame sauce.
Skim off the scum and foam from the surface, especially after cooking the meat, to keep the broth as clean as possible. Then, add the softer, leafy vegetables to the broth as you make room in the pot. Simmer for a few minutes and serve. Cook the meat as you're ready to eat, and enjoy the other ingredients while restocking the pot along the way.Tip: Prepare a fine-mesh skimmer and a 2-cup measuring cup filled with water so you can easily skim as you cook at the table. The water will help clean the skimmer.
To Make the Udon Course
When you're done cooking the ingredients, skim the broth one last time to prepare for the udon noodles. Typically, a hot pot meal ends with cooking udon noodles or porridge.
Add the udon noodles to the pot and reheat for 1–2 minutes. Lightly season the broth with salt and white pepper, if you‘d like (optional).
Dilute the individual bowls of ponzu sauce with the broth and serve the udon noodles in each bowl.

At least 30 minutes before starting this recipe, soak 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) in 4 cups water.
Now, gather all the ingredients. In this recipe, you'll make two stocks—kombu dashi and awase dashi. Use the kombu dashi for the simmering stock to cook the dumplings. The awase dashi is the clear soup broth that you'll serve into individual bowls with the shrimp dumplings.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Peel the skin off the mountain yam and measure 2.5 oz nagaimo/yamaimo (mountain yam) with a kitchen scale. Please weigh it precisely so you don't introduce too much liquid into the shrimp mixture.
Cut the mountain yam into smaller pieces, roughly ½-inch (1.25-cm) cubes.
Grate the ginger (I use a stainless steel grater from JOC Goods). Measure ½ tsp ginger, with juice.
Cut 11 oz shrimp in half sideways and remove the vein.
To Make the Simmering Stock (Kombu Dashi)
In a medium pot, gradually bring the soaked kombu and water to a simmer on medium-low heat, which helps extract the umami from the kombu. If you have never made stock using dried kelp, check out my Kombu Dashi tutorial.
Right before the water reaches a simmer, remove the kombu. Now, you have kombu dashi. You can repurpose the spent kelp by making Kombu Tsukudani. Cover the pot with a lid and set aside while you make the shrimp paste.
To Make the Shrimp Paste
Put the shrimp and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in the bowl of a food processor. Run it for 30 seconds.
The chopped shrimp will begin to break down into paste but should still retain some small minced pieces.
Next, add the mountain yam, grated ginger, and 2 tsp potato starch or cornstarch. Using the Pulse function, pulse the mixture 10 times. This will help add air to the mixture.
Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl and check the consistency. You're looking for a light, smooth texture with no minced pieces.
Continue just until it's smooth. Do not overprocess, or the mixture will become dense and heavy.
Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl.
To Cook the Shrimp Dumplings
Heat up the simmering stock (kombu dashi) in a pot to a low simmer. To shape the dumplings, measure a heaping scoopful of shrimp paste (I use a #40 [1½ Tbsp] medium cookie scoop). Then, transfer it to one of two tablespoons.
Scrape the shrimp paste from one tablespoon to the other. Repeat a few times to form a ball. Scraping off the dumpling with the spoon edge will create a smooth surface.
When you have nice surface, drop the dumpling into the simmering kombu dashi.
Continue to shape the remaining dumplings and add them to the pot. Simmer until they turn pink and register an internal temperature of 145ºF (63ºC) using an instant-read thermometer. Use chopsticks to turn them once in a while for even cooking.Meanwhile, start heating 4 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock) in a pot for serving the soup broth.
As the dumplings cook, skim off the scum floating on the simmering stock's surface. This keeps the liquid clear and clean so the debris doesn't stick to the dumplings and transfer to the soup bowls. I love using a super fine-mesh skimmer from JOC Goods as it works great for fish and vegetable broths.
To Serve
Place one shrimp dumpling in each soup bowl (I used a lidded bowl from JOC Goods). Ladle hot soup broth (awase dashi) to about halfway up the dumpling. Garnish with optional yuzu zest and mitsuba (Japanese parsley) with a knot tied in the stem.

Separating them makes it easier to toss with the ingredients in the pan and helps prevent breakage.
To Cook
Heat a large skillet (I used a 10¼-inch carbon steel frying pan), wok, or griddle on medium heat. When it's hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Add the chicken and onion to the pan in a single layer.
Stir-fry with a spatula until the chicken is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Then, add the cabbage and carrot. Toss to combine and allow the steam to evaporate. Tip: Give the ingredients direct contact with the hot cooking surface to keep things dry and develop a nice char.
Cook until the veggies are tender, then add the noodles. Toss with tongs to combine and allow the steam to escape. Fry the noodles until heated.
Add 1 serving yakisoba sauce that comes in your noodle package. If you don't have a sauce packet, add bottled or homemade yakisoba sauce, to taste. Toss to combine.

If you cannot find them, use the best, freshest eggs you can find. You can also pasteurize them yourself with an immersion circulator; see my tutorial How to Pasteurize Eggs at Home to learn how.
Gather all the ingredients. Tip: If you reduce the ingredient amounts, there won’t be enough volume for the food processor or blender to do its work, so use an immersion blender instead.
Make sure the egg yolks are at room temperature. Put 2 pasteurized egg yolks and 2 tsp Dijon mustard into the bowl of a small food processor or a blender; I used a 3-cup food processor for one batch (yields 2 cups) of this recipe. Process for 20 seconds. Tip: Mustard adds flavor and helps to emulsify the mixture, reducing the risk of the mayonnaise breaking.
With the food processor running, SLOWLY drizzle about one-third of the 1½ cups neutral oil in a thin, steady stream—about ½ cup oil for one batch of this recipe. The mixture will begin to thicken and come together. Tip: If you add the oil too fast, it won’t emulsify.
Add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, 2 tsp sugar, and ½ tsp dashi powder and give everything a whirl again.
Continue to slowly drizzle in another one-third of the oil in a thin, steady stream. I use the Stir setting while adding the oil.
Finally, add 2 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned) and 4 tsp fresh lemon juice, and slowly drizzle in the remaining one-third of the oil and process for an extra 10 seconds, just until the ingredients are combined and emulsified. Tip: Don’t blend it for too long, as homemade mayonnaise comes together pretty quickly in the food processor or blender. When blended too long, the emulsion that brought the spread together is more likely to break, either from overprocessing or overheating.
Taste the mayonnaise and adjust with salt, sugar, or lemon juice to your liking. I personally added 2 more teaspoons of sugar for a total of 4 teaspoons for one batch. Transfer the mayonnaise to an airtight container.

Here, I'll show you a quick version using my favorite dashi packet. First, add 2 dashi packets to 5 cups water in a saucepan. Start cooking over medium heat. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Remove the packets from the saucepan, shake them a few times to release more flavor, then discard them. The dashi is now ready to use.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Ingredients
To make the soup broth, combine 5 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in a measuring cup or mixing bowl. Tip: Don’t reduce the salt since the napa cabbage will release liquid during cooking and dilute the soup.
Peel and thinly slice the ginger knob into 8–10 slices ginger and set it aside.
Thinly cut 1 green onion/scallion. Put the green onion in a small serving bowl to add later to the dipping sauce.
Cut 1 head napa cabbage lengthwise into quarters. I like to cut just the white bottom half with a sharp knife, then pull apart the leafy top half with my hands. By tearing it naturally, you lose fewer leaves compared to slicing. DO NOT cut off the core from the wedges yet. They keep the leaves attached and make layering the pork belly much easier.
Carefully wash the leaves without detaching them from the core. Drain well. Don’t throw away any leaves that naturally come off while rinsing. We’ll use them later on.
To Make the Layers
Layer 1½ lb sliced pork belly into the napa cabbage wedges by placing one pork belly slice between each of the leaves. If the pork belly is longer than the cabbage wedge, trim the pork with kitchen shears and layer it in other parts of the wedge. If you have extra pork belly, put an additional slice in the outer layers that have wide leaves.
Once you‘ve tucked in the pork belly slices, carefully cut off the hard cabbage cores without disturbing the layers. Cut each wedge into 4 pieces that are each about 2–2½ inches (5–6 cm) long. Keeping the layers of cabbage and pork neatly stacked as you slice.
To Pack the Pot
Prepare a donabe or regular 10-inch pot (I used a 4.5 QT Le Creuset pot; if you‘re doubling the recipe, use two 10-inch pots or one larger pot). Begin to pack the ingredients starting from the edge of the pot and working your way toward the center. Turn the stacks on their side so the pink and green layers are visible. Position the layers parallel to the pot‘s side so they eventually form concentric circles in the pot.
I usually place the thicker cabbage leaves near the edge of the pot and the tender leaves in the center. Make sure to pack the pot tightly as the layers will become loose during cooking.
If you don’t have enough layers to pack the pot tightly, consider using a smaller pot or place other ingredients in the center. Here, I stuffed the napa cabbage leaves that came off when I cut and rinsed the cabbage. You can also put enoki mushrooms or shimeji mushrooms in the center.
If you have extra layers, hold them in a deep baking dish or a container with a tall rim. You can add them to the pot later after you‘ve remove most of the cooked layers.
Insert the thinly sliced ginger between the layers.
Pour the soup broth into the pot with the cabbage and pork layers. If you are cooking at the table, bring the pot to the table. Otherwise, start cooking it on the stove (see below).
To Set up the Table
At each place setting, prepare a medium bowl and a small dipping bowl for each person. To cook at the table, set it up a portable gas stove and place the pot on it.For the dipping sauce, add ponzu, the chopped green onion/scallion, and optional shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) to the small bowls.
To Cook and Serve
Start cooking, covered, on medium-high heat. Once boiling, skim off the scum and fat on the surface using a fine-mesh skimmer. Then, reduce the heat to medium low and cook covered until the napa cabbage is tender and the pork belly is cooked through, roughly 8–10 minutes. Serve it hot dipped in ponzu sauce and enjoy!

Please note that you will need a kitchen scale and quick-read thermometer (or an electric kettle with temperature control) to make Japanese green tea. Why be so precise? To extract the best flavor from high-quality tea leaves without ruining them. Please read the blog post for more details.
Typically, Japanese teapots can hold 200–360 ml of tea.
Japanese tea cups range from 60–100 ml. Tip (optional): I highly recommend warming up the tea cups with hot water before serving to help keep the tea hot for a longer time.
To Make the Japanese Green Tea
Use a kitchen scale to measure the loose tea leaves (here, I‘m using gyokuro). Weigh 0.35 oz sencha, 0.35 oz hojicha, 0.35 oz genmaicha, or 0.35 oz gyokuro. Then, add the loose tea leaves to your teapot. Tip: As long as you use the same variety of tea leaves, you can remember the approximate amount and skip using a scale next time.
Next, heat water in a kettle to the temperature indicated above for the type of tea leaves you’re using.
To the teapot, add the measured amount of hot water at the right temperature. I pour the hot water directly into my teapot set on a kitchen scale. For sencha, add 7.5 oz hot water at 176ºF (80ºC); for hojicha, add 8.5 oz hot water at 212ºF (100ºC); for genmaicha, add 8.5 oz hot water at 212ºF (100ºC); or for gyokuro, add 6 oz hot water at 140ºF (60ºC). Then, close the lid and let it steep according to the brew times below.

My recipe portion is for a family-size donabe, and I'm using my favorite Ginpo Kikka family-size donabe (it also comes in an induction-compatible version).
To Prepare the Ingredients
Using a sharp knife, cut out the thick core from ½ head green cabbage. Chop the cabbage into squares about 1–1½ inches (2.5–3.8 cm), then wash and dry it.
Cut off the tough ends of 3 oz garlic chives (Chinese chives or Nira) and slice it into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Next, slice ½ block medium-firm tofu (momen dofu) into thin slabs.
Thinly slice 6 cloves garlic crosswise. Cut 2 pieces dried red chili pepper into thin rounds, discarding the seeds if you prefer a less spicy hot pot.
Cut ½ lb sliced pork belly into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.
To Clean and Parboil the Offal
Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut 1 lb beef small intestine into 1-foot (30-cm) tubes.
Initial rinse: Clean the inside of each tube with running water while rubbing it from the outside. Straighten the intestine so water flows smoothly and you can clean inside the tubes. Take your time.
Cut the tubes into smaller pieces no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Place them in a large bowl.
Rub with salt: Sprinkle with 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and rub it into the intestine pieces with your hand.
Massage well with the salt to absorb odors and help remove slime. Rinse it again, using the force of the running water to thoroughly wash away any remaining dirt or odors from the offal. Drain.
Rub with flour: Now, generously coat the intestine pieces with 4 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) Rub it in thoroughly with your hand.
Wash off the flour and impurities with water and drain in a sieve.
Final rinse: Clean the pieces one by one in running water. Take your time to wash them thoroughly, then place in a clean bowl. Tip: Read the Notes for how to clean the kitchen sink after handling offal.
Parboil: Bring 4 cups (1L) of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Once boiling, add 1 Tbsp sake. Then, add the intestine pieces.
Blanch the offal for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate or tray and set it aside. Tip: Parboil it only briefly to remove excess oil; do allow the fat to render. This fat is essential for a delicious creamy and savory broth, so we want to cook it in the main hot pot.
To Mix the Hot Pot Broth
Grind 2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle. Leave some seeds unground for texture.
Combine 4 cups chicken stock/broth, 3 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp oyster sauce in a measuring cup or bowl.
Add the ground sesame seeds and stir to combine.
To Cook the Motsunabe
Add the broth ingredients to a donabe or heavy-bottomed pot. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
Dissolve 2 Tbsp miso into the hot broth. I'm using my favorite miso muddler and draining ladle.
Add all of the cabbage and 6 oz bean sprouts. Cover the pot and bring to a simmer. Tip: Don't worry, it may look like a lot at first, but they will eventually wilt.
Once simmering, add the pork belly on one side and the intestine on the other side, keeping the middle open. Place the tofu on one end. Finally, place the garlic cloves, garlic chives, chili pieces, and sesame seeds garnish across the middle. Cover and cook for 10–15 minutes. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium low and continue to simmer.
To Serve
When the cabbage is tender and the pork is cooked through, serve and enjoy it with optional yuzu kosho (Japanese citrus chili paste).

Cook 2¼ cups (3 rice cooker cups) of uncooked short-grain white rice to yield 6⅔ cups (990 g) of cooked rice.
Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Cook the Rice
Wash and rinse: Put 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice in a large bowl. Add enough cold tap water to wet the rice, then drain. Use your fingers to gently agitate and “wash“ the wet grains in a circular motion for 10–15 seconds. Rinse with more water, then immediately pour off the cloudy water. Repeat washing and rinsing two more times until the water is almost clear. Drain it well in a fine-mesh sieve and shake off any excess water.
Soak and cook: Transfer the well-drained rice to the inner pot of a rice cooker. Add 2¼ cups water to the pot. Level the rice, then place 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) on top. Soak the rice in the water for 20–30 minutes. Then, start cooking. Tip: If you don‘t have a rice cooker, cook the rice in a pot on the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe with the measured water I specify in this recipe.
To Season the Sushi Rice
Make homemade sushi vinegar (optional): Combine ⅓ cup rice vinegar (unseasoned), 3 Tbsp sugar, and 1½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in a small saucepan. Bring it to a near simmer over medium-high heat and whisk to completely dissolve the sugar. You could also microwave the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar. Set aside to cool.
When the rice is cooked, discard the used kombu. Tip: You can repurpose it to make simmered kombu.
If using a sushi oke (hangiri), moisten it with running water, drain well, and dry with a clean towel. Transfer the hot cooked rice to the sushi oke; you could also use a large salad bowl or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Then, spread out the rice evenly so it will cool faster. Tip: A wooden tub helps absorb excess moisture.
Immediately drizzle ⅓ cup seasoned rice vinegar (sushi vinegar) or the cooled homemade sushi vinegar over the hot rice.
With a rice paddle, gently “slice” the hot rice at a 45-degree angle to incorporate the sushi vinegar and separate the rice chunks. Do not stir or mash the rice because that may break the grains and make it mushy. While slicing, vigorously fan the rice with a paddle fan or other fan; this wicks away the excess moisture and makes the rice shine. Gently flip the rice after every few slices.
Repeat slicing and fanning until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin. Cover the prepared sushi rice with a damp cloth while you prepare the fillings. Keep it covered at all times to prevent drying.
To Prepare the Fillings
Crabmeat: Cut 5 oz real or imitation crabmeat into smaller pieces, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.
Separate and shred the crabmeat with your fingers and place in a bowl. Add 1 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and mix it all together.
Cucumber: Cut 2 Japanese or Persian cucumbers into quarters lengthwise.
Remove and discard the seeds. Then, cut it lengthwise into thin, long strips.
Avocado: Cut 1 avocado (large) in half lengthwise around the seed: Insert the knife through the skin and flesh until it meets the pit. Rotate the avocado so the knife slices all the way around the pit. Twist the two halves until they separate.
Set the half with the pit on the cutting board or hold it with a folded kitchen towel. Gently hit the pit with the heel of the knife to embed the edge. Twist the knife and pit in a counter direction to the avocado; the pit should come out smoothly. Next, slice the avocado in half lengthwise to make quarters (leave the skin on).
Carefully cut the quarters lengthwise into thin, ¼-inch (6-mm) slices, again leaving the skin on. Squeeze the juice of ½ lemon on the slices to prevent browning.
Nori: Cut 4 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) in half crosswise to make 8 half sheets.
To Build the Rice Layer
Wrap the front and back of the bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap.
Keep the sides uncovered so no air gets trapped.
Dip a ¾-cup measuring cup into a bowl of water to wet it, shake off gently, and fill the cup with sushi rice.
Lay a nori half sheet, shiny side down, on the bamboo sushi mat. Wet your fingers in the water bowl and evenly spread ¾ cup (110 g) sushi rice across the nori. Apply very gentle pressure so you don‘t mash the rice grains. Alternatively, you can use a plastic rice paddle to keep your hands clean.
Sprinkle the rice with about ½ Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds.
To Fill and Roll
Flip it over so the rice is now facing down on the mat. Place the nori about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the mat's bottom edge. Starting ½ inch (1.3 cm) up from the bottom of the nori, line up one portion of crabmeat, avocado with skins removed, and cucumber across the nori. Tip: Don‘t add too much filling, or it‘ll be extremely difficult to seal the roll.
Grab the bottom edge of the mat with your index fingers and thumbs and hold the filling in place with your other fingers.
Roll the mat over the filling until the rice at the bottom edge meets the nori near the top edge. Then, flip back the mat‘s bottom edge toward you.
Firmly squeeze the roll through the mat with one hand while you use your other hand to pull the top of the mat away from you. Tip: This tension helps form a tight cylinder.
Next, use one hand to lift and slightly pull the mat's bottom edge as you use your other hand to roll the sushi and mat forward. Keep gentle pressure on the mat as you roll.
To shape, press the top of the roll with your index fingers while squeezing the sides with your thumbs and other fingers. Your sushi roll is now done.Transfer it to a tray or plate and cover with a damp cloth at all times to prevent drying. Continue making the remaining rolls.
To Serve
With a very sharp knife, cut each roll in half crosswise. Then, cut each half into 4 pieces. Clean the knife with a damp cloth after every few cuts.
Place the bamboo sushi mat over the cut roll and re-shape it one last time. Remove the mat and add the optional toppings of your choice, like ikura (salmon roe) or yuzu-flavored tobiko (flying fish roe).
Serve with a small dish of soy sauce and wasabi for dipping and pickled sushi ginger (optional) on the side. Enjoy!

Cut off the tough ends of 1 small bunch garlic chives (Chinese chives or Nira). Slice the leafy parts into 1½-inch (4-cm) pieces.
Slice 1 chicken breast into 1½-inch (4 cm) squares of equal thickness. I use the sogigiri Japanese cutting technique. To do this, tilt your knife back and slice at a slanted angle.

To Cook
Preheat a large frying pan or carbon steel pan over medium heat. When it's hot, add 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken. leaving space between the pieces. I cooked it in two batches. This allows the air to circulate so they sear nicely. Cover and cook for 3 minutes.

Combine 3 Tbsp miso and 1 Tbsp sugar in a small bowl. Mix well to dissolve the sugar.
Add 1 Tbsp mirin and ½ Tbsp sake and stir. If needed, you can add a bit more sake until you reach your preferred consistency, as some miso is chunkier than others. Mix well and set aside.
To Prepare the Eggplants
Cut off the stem and calyx of 3 Japanese eggplants. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise from stem to tip, creating boat-like halves. If your eggplants are long, you can cut them in half crosswise so they're shorter.
With the knife, score the cut surface of eggplant diagonally about ⅛ inch (3 mm) deep and apart. Work in one direction first and then the other, creating a crisscross pattern on the flesh. Tip: In addition to improving the presentation, this crisscross scoring helps the eggplants cook faster and absorb more flavor.
Soak them in water for 10 minutes to remove the astringency. Blot them with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Brush the cut surface with 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil. Turn them over so they are cut side down on the baking sheet.
To Bake
Bake the eggplants at 425ºF (220ºC) for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut 1 green onion/scallion into thin rounds. Roll up 5 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba) and cut them into julienned strips.
After 15 minutes, the eggplant flesh should be soft and the skin slightly shriveled. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Now, preheat the broiler. Keep the rack in the same center position, roughly 7 inches (18 cm) away from the heating element.
To Broil
Carefully turn the eggplants cut side up and brush the flesh with a layer of sweet miso glaze. Coat the surface completely. You don't need to use all the glaze; one batch makes enough for 3 large or 5 medium eggplants. Tip: You can freeze any leftover glaze to use later or enjoy it as a dip for veggies.
Place the eggplants under the broiler until the glaze begins to bubble and caramelize, about 3–5 minutes. Remove from the broiler. Tip: The cooking time varies based on how far away you place the food from the heating element.
To Serve
Sprinkle the baked eggplants with 2 tsp toasted white sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and julienned shiso leaves. I serve a dab of yuzu kosho (optional) on a maple leaf for a spicy kick. Serve immediately.

To Make the Dashi
Add 1 cup water and 1 dashi packet to a small pot. Start cooking over medium heat. Tip: You can substitute the packet with Awase Dashi, dashi powder, or Vegan Dashi. If you‘re new to Japanese soup stock, learn more in my ultimate dashi guide How to Make Dashi.
After it starts boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Shake the bag a few times to release more flavor and then discard the packet. The dashi is ready to use.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Thinly slice ½ onion; I highly recommend cutting it thinly to reduce the cooking time. Next, slice 1 green onion/scallion and set aside for garnish.
Crack 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into a medium bowl. Lift the egg whites 5–6 times with a pair of chopsticks to “cut“ them into smaller clumps. This will marble the yolks and whites and prevent the whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs. Tip: Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the egg in your finished dish.
Cut 2 tonkatsu cutlets into slices about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
To Cook the Katsudon
Place the onion slices in a single layer in a large frying pan that can fit 2 cutlets. Then, add the dashi to the pan.
Cover with a tight-fitting lid to prevent evaporation. Then, turn on the heat to medium and cook until the onion is tender and almost translucent.
Then, add 2 tsp sugar and 2 Tbsp mirin.
Add 2 Tbsp soy sauce and mix together.
Place the 2 tonkatsu cutlets on top of the onion and cover with the lid until the tonkatsu is heated through and the broth is simmering, about 2 minutes. The bottom of the tonkatsu will absorb the broth.
Now, evenly distribute the egg in a circular (spiral) pattern over the tonkatsu and onion. Avoid the edges of the pan where the egg can easily overcook.

To Prepare the Vegetables and Chicken
Cut 1 head broccoli into bite-sized florets.
Cut ½ onion into 6 wedges.
Peel 1 carrot and 1 Yukon gold potato.
Cut the carrot into bite-sized chunks. I rotate the carrot a quarter turn between cuts. To learn this Japanese cutting technique, see How to Cut Rangiri.
Cut the potato into 1½-inch chunks and soak them in a bowl of water until ready to use.
Cut the stems off 4 cremini mushrooms and cut the caps into thin slices.
Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 3 minutes until barely tender and still crisp. Remove from the water and let cool. Tip: Don’t overcook the broccoli now as it will cook a bit more when we reheat it in the stew.
Cut 1 boneless, skinless chicken thigh into into 1½-inch pieces of even thickness. I tilt the knife back and slice at a diagonal. The slanted surface gives each piece a flatter and more open area so the chicken cooks evenly and faster. To learn this Japanese cutting technique, see How to Cut Sogigiri. Next, season the chicken pieces with ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Cook
Preheat a pot over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Add the onion to the hot oil and sauté for 2 minutes.
Add the chicken to the pot and cook until no longer pink.
Add the drained potato and carrot. Stir to coat with oil.
Add the mushrooms and coat with oil. Then, add 2 cups water.
Push the ingredients into the liquid to submerge them and cover the pot with a lid. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes or until the potato is tender. Meanwhile, skim off the scum and fat from the surface of the broth. Tip: Set a timer so you don't overcook the potato.
To Add the Roux
Pierce a potato with a bamboo skewer to see if it goes in easily. If it does, turn off the heat and add 4 cubes Japanese Cream Stew Mix. Add 1–2 roux cubes to a ladleful of hot broth, mix it with chopsticks to dissolve completely, and stir it in to the stock. Repeat with the remaining roux cubes.

Gather all the ingredients. I highly recommend using fresh panko (called nama panko) from a Japanese grocery store, if available. If you can’t get it, follow my instructions below to make fresh panko using dried panko. Make sure to use a Japanese brand of panko from Japan. Western “panko breadcrumbs” are a bit different from authentic Japanese panko.
To Prepare the Shredded Cabbage (optional)
In Japan, we serve tonkatsu with a side of fresh shredded cabbage. To prepare it, shred ¼ head green cabbage very finely with a sharp knife or slicer. I love to use a cabbage slicer (you can get one from Amazon or JOC Goods) because it saves time and energy! I also thinly slice 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber diagonally, then cut them into thin strips. Toss the cabbage and cucumber together and set aside. Prepare 4 Tbsp Japanese sesame dressing (store bought or make homemade Japanese Sesame Dressing) and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
To Make the Dipping Sauce
Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds with a Japanese mortar and pestle. Leave some seeds unground for texture.
Divide the ground sesame seeds among individual dipping plates or bowls. Then divide 4 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce (store bought or homemade) among them. Set aside until ready to serve. Each person can mix it together when ready to eat. Note: In Japan, we often drizzle straight tonkatsu sauce on our cutlets without adding sesame seeds. Feel free to serve this dish with straight tonkatsu sauce instead, if you prefer.
To Prepare the Fresh Panko and Breading
If you are using dry panko from the store, place ½ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) in a deep dish and spray with water until the panko is moist (I use a mister). Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the panko becomes soft and tender. Optionally, you can make fresh panko by pulsing some Shokupan (Japanese Pullman bread) in a food processor.
Meanwhile, prepare the other breading ingredients. Crack 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) into a deep dish or my favorite prep trays. Add ½ Tbsp neutral oil and whisk together until well combined. Then, prepare another dish or tray with 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour). Tip: By adding oil, the breading won’t detach from the meat while deep-frying and this will help seal in the meat's juices and flavor.
To Prepare the Pork
Use a sharp knife to remove the extra fat from 2 boneless pork loin chops (½ inch thick). Then, make several small slits on the connective tissue (the white area) between the meat and fat. Tip: Red meat and fat have different elasticities, and they shrink and expand at different rates while cooking. These slits will allow the tonkatsu to stay flat during cooking instead of curling up.
Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of the connective tissue.
Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a meat tenderizer/mallet.
Mold the cutlet back into its original shape with your hands.
Season both sides with ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
To Bread the Pork
First, dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Next, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well. Tip: Excess flour will prevent the egg mixture from adhering to the pork.
Lastly, dredge the pork in the fresh panko and gently press it to adhere to the cutlet. Gently shake off any excess, then place the breaded cutlets onto a tray or plate. Set them aside for 5–10 minutes to set the breading. Tip: The panko will “puff up” while deep-frying, so it doesn't have to be fluffy at this stage.
To Cook: The First Fry
Add 3 cups neutral oil to a pot. Make sure your oil is 1¾–2 inches (5 cm) deep. I use the tip of a chopstick to measure. Preheat on medium heat and bring the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). Tip: If you don’t have a thermometer, stick a chopstick in the oil; if you see tiny bubbles appear around the tip, it is hot enough. Alternatively, you can drop in a piece of panko; if it sinks down and immediately pops up to the surface, then the oil is ready.
Gently put one pork cutlet into the oil and let it cook for 1 minute. Don‘t flip it or touch it for 30 seconds. Tip: Why one piece at a time? Too much food at once will drastically reduce the oil temperature, and the tonkatsu will absorb too much oil. You should see big oil bubbles when you add the pork. Also, monitor the oil temperature so it doesn't rise above 340ºF (170ºC). If it does, the breading will get dark before the pork is cooked and you meat will be undercooked.
After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.
Remove the pork and let the excess oil drip off by holding the cutlet vertically over the pot for a few seconds. Place it on a wire rack or paper towel and prop it on its side, if possible, to drain excess oil. Let it sit for 4 minutes. The residual heat will continue to cook the meat as it rests.
Turn off the heat temporarily. Scoop up and discard any fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer. Keep the oil clean of fried crumbs, which can burn and make the oil dark and dirty. Then, turn on the heat again to medium and bring the oil back to 340ºF (170ºC).
While the first cutlet is resting on the wire rack, deep-fry the second cutlet for 1 minute without flipping. Do not touch it for 30 seconds.
Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute.
Take out the pork and drain the excess oil as before. Place it on the wire rack and let it rest for 4 minutes. Clean the oil of fried crumbs.
The Second Fry
Raise the oil temperature to 355ºF (180ºC). After 4 minutes, the first piece of pork is ready for its second frying. Fry the cutlet again for 30 seconds on one side, then 30 seconds on the other side. Remove from the oil, let the oil drip off, and drain on the wire rack for 2 minutes. This prevents the breading from getting soggy on one side.
Clean the fried crumbs in the oil, then fry the second cutlet again. Remove from the pot and drain the excess oil as before.
To Serve
Cut the tonkatsu crosswise into slices about ¾ inch (2 cm) wide.
Transfer to a plate and serve it with the shredded cabbage and cucumber, the sesame dressing in small individual cups, and the sesame tonkatsu dipping sauce on the side.
To Store
You can store leftovers in an airtight container and freeze for up to a month. To reheat, put the defrosted or frozen tonkatsu on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper.

To Dispose of Used Cooking Oil
Please follow your local guidelines for disposing of cooking oil. In my neighborhood, we can take it to the recycling center and dump it into a designated container, so it’s very easy.
If you are using a Japanese oil solidifier, add the powder into the hot oil right after deep-frying and mix well.
Set it aside and let the oil completely solidify as it cools, which may take overnight.

To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut 1.5 oz garlic chives (Chinese chives or Nira) and 4 oz sliced pork belly into 2-inch pieces.
Mince 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press). Using a mortar and pestle, grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds. I like to leave some seeds uncrushed for texture.
To Cook
Heat a saucepan on medium heat. When hot, add 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil. Then, add the pork belly and stir-fry.

To Prepare the Ingredients
Slice ½ onion thinly.
Remove the tough core of 2–3 leaves green cabbage. Then, cut the leaves into pieces that are 1 inch (2.5 cm) square.
Peel 2 inches carrot and cut it into thin slabs. Then, julienne the slabs into thin strips 2 inches (5 cm) long.
Discard the tough stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms and slice the mushroom caps.

To Stir-Fry the Yaki Udon
Preheat a large frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and distribute it evenly. Add the pork belly and stir-fry.
Season the pork with ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Cook until it‘s no longer pink.
Add the onion slices and stir-fry until tender.
Add the cabbage, carrot strips, shiitake mushrooms, and green onions. Mix it all together until the ingredients are coated with oil.
Cover with a lid and reduce the stove‘s heat to low. Let the ingredients steam for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly wilted.
Add the udon noodles to the pan and toss with a pair of tongs to combine. (It‘s a lot easier to use tongs than two spatulas).
Add the ingredients for either seasonings option A or B to the pan. For option A, add ½ tsp dashi powder, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sake, and 1 tsp mirin.

To Make the Teriyaki Sauce
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the ingredients for the teriyaki sauce: 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Mix well to dissolve the sugar.
To help dissolve the sugar, you can microwave the mixture for 30 seconds.
To Prepare the Salmon
Rinse 2 skin-on salmon fillets and pat dry. Season one side with some of the ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Tip: The salmon skin will hold the flesh together while cooking.
Flip over and season the other side with the remaining salt and black pepper.
Sprinkle half of the 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) on one side of the salmon and coat evenly. Tip: Coating the salmon with flour helps retain its umami flavor and juiciness. It also helps absorb the sauce and thickens it.
Flip over and sprinkle the rest of the flour on the other side. Gently press it to adhere, then remove the excess flour.
To Cook the Salmon
Heat a frying pan over medium heat. When hot, add ½ Tbsp neutral oil and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Do not burn the butter. If the pan gets too hot, reduce the heat or move the pan off the heat temporarily. Next, sear the salmon skin: One fillet at a time, press the skin against the hot pan‘s surface for 15 seconds before laying the fillet skin side down in the pan. Repeat with the other fillet. Tip: The presentation side (the skin side) should go into the pan first because you will get the best browning on the first side that hits the clean pan.
Cook the salmon for 3 minutes until the bottom is golden brown, and then flip.
To the pan, add 1 Tbsp sake—1 Tbsp for thin fillets and no more than 2 Tbsp for thicker fillets. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce the stove‘s heat to low. Steam the salmon for about 3–5 minutes, depending on the fillet thickness. If the sake has evaporated but the salmon isn‘t cooked through yet, add another tablespoon of sake and continue steaming.
Cook the salmon until it registers an internal temperature of 125–130°F (52–54ºC) at the thickest part of the fillet (I use a Thermapen instant-read thermometer). Then, transfer the salmon to a tray or plate. These fillets were about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) thick and took roughly 4 minutes to cook. Tip: The USDA recommends cooking fish to an internal temperature of 145°F (63ºC); however, the residual heat will continue to cook the salmon, so you must remove the fillets at 125–130°F (52–54ºC) to avoid overcooking.
Add the teriyaki sauce ingredients to the pan and increase the heat a bit. When the sauce starts to boil, add the salmon back to the pan.
Spoon the sauce over the salmon. When the sauce thickens, turn off the heat. Transfer the salmon to a plate and drizzle the sauce on top.
To Serve
Serve immediately. I like to serve my Teriyaki Salmon as part of a Japanese-style meal with Green Bean Gomaae (Sesame Dressing) or pan-seared asparagus, Tamagoyaki, Homemade Miso Soup, and Steamed Rice.

To Make the Dressing
In a saucepan, combine 4 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 2 Tbsp sugar, ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and ½ tsp soy sauce. Alternatively, you can use a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in the microwave until the sugar dissolves.
Place the saucepan over medium heat and whisk the ingredients together well (I use this whisk). Once the sugar dissolves completely, remove from the heat and let it cool. Tip: If you decrease the sugar amount (which I don't recommend), you may find that the vinegar tastes too strong. If it's still too strong for you after adding the cucumbers, you can dilute it at this stage with a very small amount of Dashi (Japanese soup stock), Vegan Dashi, or water.
To Make the Sunomono
Soak 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed in a bowl of water and let it rehydrate for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel the skin of 2 Japanese cucumbers alternately to create a striped pattern. Then, thinly slice the cucumbers into rounds.
Sprinkle 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt on the cucumber and gently massage it in. Set aside for 5 minutes. The salt draws out the moisture from the cucumbers so it doesn't dilute the dressing later.
Use your hand(s) to squeeze out the liquid from the rehydrated wakame seaweed and add it to a medium bowl.
Squeeze out the liquid from the cucumber slices. Add them to the bowl with the wakame.

For this recipe, I use teppogushi or “gun skewers” that have a flat tab for a handle. You can buy them at Japanese markets or on Amazon. If you can‘t find them, you can use regular bamboo skewers.
Soak 10–12 5-inch bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes (or at least 10 minutes while you're prepping the ingredients).
Separate the green part of 2 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) from the white and light green parts. Cut the white and light green parts into 1¼-inch (3-cm) pieces. Cut the green parts in half crosswise.
To Make the Yakitori Sauce (Tare)
To a small saucepan, add ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup mirin, ¼ cup sake, and ¼ cup water.
Add 2 tsp brown sugar and the green part of the Tokyo negi.
Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce reduces to one-third of its original volume. It will take about 30 minutes. Let it cool to room temperature before using. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine as it cools. Tip: You can make the sauce ahead of time. To store, remove the green onion and pour into a mason jar. Keep in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 months.
Tip: If you want to serve your yakitori with extra sauce, reserve one-third of the sauce in a small bowl for final basting, just before serving. To prevent cross-contamination, use this reserved sauce with a clean brush only after the chicken is fully cooked.
To Assemble the Skewers
Cut 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs into 1¼-inch (3-cm) squares.
On a flat work surface, fold a slice of chicken in half. Holding the skewer at a 45-degree angle, pierce the side of the folded meat. Then, tilt the skewer down so it‘s parallel to the work surface and thread it all the way through. Position the chicken next to the handle.
Next, add a piece of Tokyo negi perpendicular to the skewer, packing it snuggly next to the chicken piece.
Add another piece of chicken, then another piece of Tokyo negi.
End with a piece of chicken. Each 5-inch skewer will hold about 3 chicken slices and 2 Tokyo negi pieces.
To Broil/Grill the Yakitori (recommended)
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Place an oven-safe wire rack on top. Grease the grate of the wire rack with neutral oil to keep the chicken from sticking.
Place the skewers on top in two rows, with the handles resting along the edges of the baking sheet. Cover the top and bottom of the handles with folded strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.
Turn on the broiler to High (550ºF/288ºC) with a rack placed on the middle position of the oven, about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the heating element. Wait until the heating elements are hot, about 3–5 minutes. Then, place the skewers under the broiler. Broil for 6 minutes. Tip: When broiling, you don‘t adjust the oven temperature; instead, you control the distance between the heating element and the surface of the food. It‘s similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill.
After 6 minutes, brush the meat and Tokyo negi with the yakitori sauce.
Flip the skewers carefully with a pair of tongs. Brush the sauce on the other side. Continue to broil for 3–4 minutes to caramelize the sauce.
Finally, flip one more time (this is the presentation side). Baste with the sauce, then broil for an additional 1–2 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
To Pan-Fry the Yakitori (optional)
Heat a large frying pan on medium heat. When it‘s hot, add about 1 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot, place the skewers in the pan in a single layer (you may have to cook in batches). Cook until both sides are brown, about 5 minutes each side. Then, cover and cook on low heat for 2–3 minutes. Add the sauce to the pan and cook until well coated on both sides. Remove from the heat.
To Serve
Transfer the skewers to a serving plate, presentation side up. Optionally, with a clean brush, baste the top of the chicken skewers with the reserved sauce. Serve with shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) and enjoy!

To Make the Filling
Discard the thick core of ¾ lb green cabbage and cut it into thin strips about ⅓-inch (1 cm) wide.
Finely chop the strips crosswise into very small pieces, especially the thick white parts of the leaves. Then, run your knife through the cabbage to mince it finer.
Sprinkle the minced cabbage with 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and massage together with your hands. Transfer it to a bowl and set aside until the cabbage is wilted. Tip: Alternatively, you can blanch or microwave the cabbage for a minute or two to soften the thick and hard leaves. Or, you can skip wilting altogether.
Mince 2 green onions/scallions into small pieces.
Remove the stems from 2 shiitake mushrooms and mince the caps into small pieces.
Grate the ginger with a ceramic grater and add 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice) to a small plate. Mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press) and add to the plate.
Combine the green onions, shiitake mushrooms, and ½ lb ground pork in a large bowl. Now, add the seasonings: 2 tsp sake, 2 tsp toasted sesame oil, 2 tsp soy sauce, and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
Mix well and knead the mixture with your hand (I wear plastic disposable gloves) until it becomes sticky and pale in color.
Next, squeeze the water out from the salted cabbage and add to the meat mixture.
Knead the mixture again with your hand to evenly distribute the cabbage into the meat.
To Fold the Gyoza
Prepare a small bowl of water and a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or dusted with 2 Tbsp potato starch (or cornstarch). Open 1 package gyoza wrappers and cover them with a damp towel or plastic wrap at all times so they don‘t dry out.
Place a wrapper in the palm of your non-dominant hand (left hand for me). Use a small cookie scoop to place a scant 1 Tbsp or less of filling in the center. Do not overstuff. (If you‘re new to gyoza making, use ¾ Tbsp of filling.) Flatten it with the scooper bowl, making sure to press out any air pockets in the filling.
Dip one finger in the water and use it to moisten a circle around the outer ¼ inch (6 mm) of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch the two sides together at the top center, but don’t seal it yet.
In this recipe, I show you how to fold gyoza with the pleats leaning toward the center. If you want the pleats leaning toward one side, check out my How to Fold Gyoza post.
Start on the right side near the top center. To make the first pleat, use your right thumb and index finger to fold the wrapper‘s top half into a pleat that leans toward the center. Use your left thumb and index finger to press the folded pleat tightly against the back half of the wrapper.
Here is what it looks like from the front.
Repeat folding along the right side about once every ¼ inch (6 mm), making 3–4 pleats total.
Here what it looks like from the front.
Press down the pleats to seal any gap.
Now, pleat the left side of the gyoza, starting near the top center. To make the first pleat, use your left thumb and index finger to fold the wrapper‘s top half into a pleat that leans toward the center. Use your right thumb and index finger to press the folded pleat tightly against the back half of the wrapper.
Here is what it looks like from the front.
Repeat folding along the left side about once every ¼ inch (6 mm), making 3–4 pleats total.
Here is what it looks like from the front.
Press the pleats one last time.
Evenly distribute the filling and shape the gyoza to create a flat side on the bottom.
Place your finished gyoza on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap to avoid drying. Repeat to fold the remaining wrappers.
To Freeze Uncooked (optional)
If you want to store uncooked gyoza to cook later (optional), now is the time to freeze them. Before the filling starts to release moisture and make the wrappers soggy, lay out the gyoza on a sheet pan or plate in a single layer so they‘re not touching. Then, cover with plastic wrap or a large resealable bag. Place the sheet pan in the freezer to flash freeze the gyoza until solid (or at least frozen on the outside).
Once the gyoza are frozen solid, pack them in an airtight bag. Because you flash froze them, the gyoza won’t stick to each other in the bag. Store the gyoza in the freezer for up to a month. When you’re ready to cook them, place the frozen gyoza directly in your frying pan. Follow the regular cooking instructions below, but steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.
To Cook the Fresh Gyoza
Cook the gyoza in batches or use two frying pans. First, dust off any potato starch from the gyoza bottoms using a pastry brush.
Heat a large nonstick or carbon steel frying pan over medium heat (I use an 11"" carbon steel pan). When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot, place the gyoza in the pan, flat side down. Arrange them in a single layer in a circular pattern, and leave space between each piece so they don‘t touch.
Alternatively, you can arrange them in one or two rows. Leave space between each piece so they don‘t touch each other.
Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown, about 3 minutes. Then, add 4 Tbsp water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid.
Steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates. Tip: If you‘re cooking frozen gyoza, steam them for an extra 1–2 minutes.
Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Drizzle 1 tsp toasted sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan. Cook, uncovered, until the gyoza is browned and crisp on the bottom.
Remove to a plate. Repeat the process to cook the other batches.
To Serve
Transfer to a serving plate and serve with individual bowls of dipping sauce on the side. For each individual serving, combine 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and the optional ⅛ tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil) in a small dipping bowl and mix together. Enjoy!

Make Ahead (Optional): 1–2 days in advance, I prepare the Simmered Shiitake Mushrooms and 3 Ingredient Simple Tamagoyaki and store them in the fridge until ready to use. For the cooked shrimp, I devein shell-on large shrimp (see How to Devein Shrimp), push their backs to straighten, then quickly boil them in 2 cups water with a splash of sake until their color changes. I peel the shells afterward.
The sushi rice takes about 90 minutes to make. Please note that 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked white rice. You can follow my How to Make Sushi Rice recipe for step-by-step instructions on how to cook the rice and add the sushi seasoning. Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut off the ends of 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber. (Optional: You can peel the skin alternately to create stripes.) Then, cut it lengthwise in half, then lengthwise again into quarters.
Remove the seeds by slicing them off with a knife. Then, cut the quarters lengthwise in half again. You should now have 8 cucumber sticks.
Cut 1 Tamagoyaki (Japanese Rolled Omelette) lengthwise into 8 strips.
Cut each of the 4 cooked shrimp in half lengthwise.
Cut 1 unagi (freshwater eel) fillet lengthwise into 4 strips.
To Add the Sushi Rice and Fillings
Make one roll at a time. Set the bamboo sushi mat on a work surface with the slats running sideways (horizontally) for rolling. Place 1 nori sheet shiny side down on the mat. Leave about 3–4 slats visible on the edge nearest you. Moisten a 1 cup measure in a small bowl of water, shake off the excess, and scoop 1 cup sushi rice. Tip: For thick sushi rolls, we typically place the nori sheet's short side along the mat's bottom edge closest to you so there's more room to roll the ingredients. When we serve the ehomaki uncut, we often roll it with the long side closest to you so it's thinner and easier to eat. You can decide which way to position the nori depending on if you serve the rolls whole or sliced.
Place the measured sushi rice in the middle of the nori sheet. Gently spread the rice with your fingers, leaving an empty strip of nori across the bottom ½ inch (1.5 cm) and top 1 inch (2.5 cm). Don't mash the rice, and make sure to spread it evenly so the roll isn't bumpy. Tip: Instead of using your fingers, you can use a rice paddle. Hold it vertically to avoid mashing the rice.
Leave a ¼ inch strip of rice at the bottom, then add the first layer of fillings, beginning with the easy-to-hold ingredients. Start with 2 cucumber sticks, lining them up across the width of the nori sheet. Then, place the 1 strip unagi, 2 strips shrimp, and 2 strips tamagoyaki, turning the shrimp and unagi on their side edge to keep the first layer compact. Finally, add a portion of the simmered shiitake mushrooms last so they won't fall out when rolling. Tip: Keep in mind what the filling will look like after it's rolled up. I try my best (but don't always succeed) to arrange the ingredients so similar colors are not next to each other.
For the second layer, place 2 strips sashimi-grade salmon and 2 strips sashimi-grade tuna on top of the cucumber and unagi.
To Roll the Ehomaki
Grab the bottom edge of the mat and nori sheet with your thumbs and index fingers. Tightly roll the bottom edge over the filling while holding the ingredients in place with your other fingers. Lift away the mat slightly as you roll firmly until the rice at the bottom and top edges meet.
Press it through the mat to tighten the rice and filling.
Now, hold the lifted edge of the mat with one hand and pull it forward as you use your other hand to finish rolling the rest of the way. Then, release the edge of the mat and press the roll through the mat to correct its shape. Continue rolling the rest of the ehomaki.
To Serve
Optionally, you can cut off the ends of the roll for a neater presentation.

To Prepare the Mushrooms
To rehydrate the shiitake, add 6 dried shiitake mushrooms and about 1 cup water to a bowl and let them soak for 30 minutes. Place a smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged.
When the shiitake are soft and tender, remove them from the soaking liquid and gently squeeze them out. Cut off and discard the stems. Then, cut the mushroom caps into very thin slices and squeeze out any remaining liquid.
To Cook
Place the sliced shiitake in a saucepan. Add 1 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 1 Tbsp sake, and 1 Tbsp mirin.
Add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix it all together.
Cook over medium-low heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces and is almost gone, about 20 minutes. Leave enough broth to just cover the mushrooms. Remove from the heat and let the mushrooms cool completely in the simmering broth to absorb more flavor.

Choose one of three methods to cook kiri mochi: Using an oven broiler, a frying pan on the stovetop, or a pot on the stovetop.
To Make the Kinako Mixture
Mix together 4 Tbsp kinako (roasted soybean flour) and 2 Tbsp sugar in a bowl and set aside.
1. Oven Method (Broiling)
Preheat: Place the oven rack in the middle position and preheat the broiler on High, or a toaster oven at 400ºF (200ºC), for 3 minutes.Place the mochi on top of an ungreased oven-safe wire rack set in a baking sheet.Broil: Put them in the oven. Set the timer for 3 minutes.
After 3 minutes, flip the mochi. The top should be light golden and slightly puffed.
Grill the other side until the top is golden brown, about 3 minutes. When puffed, the mochi should be soft inside.
2. Stovetop Method (Grilling)
Line a cold frying pan with parchment paper and set the kiri mochi pieces on top.
Turn on the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid. Set the timer for 5 minutes. Tip: Covering the pan traps heat and moisture, helping the mochi cook evenly and puff up. Remove the lid as the mochi begins to puff.
Occasionally lift the lid to check if the mochi starts to puff. If the bottom develops golden toast marks in one spot (see the picture), press down gently once to encourage even toasting.
After 5 minutes, flip them over and grill on the other side for 5–6 minutes, until puffed, browned, and soft inside.
3. Stovetop Method (Boiling)
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add 4 Japanese rice cake (kiri mochi) to the pot. Gently simmer the mochi for 2 minutes, turning them occasionally with a spoon for even cooking.
When the mochi is soft to its center, promptly transfer it to the bowl with the kinako mixture from the pot. Dredge the hot mochi completely in the sweetened kinako, generously coating it on all sides. (Skip the next step ""To Flavor the Mochi."")

Thighs are more forgiving to cook than chicken breasts, too. Read more about it in the blog post above.For this recipe, I focus on skinless and boneless thighs since that‘s how they‘re commonly sold in the US. However, if you have the chance, I encourage you to try my skin-on recipe at the end of the instructions below.
Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Mix the Teriyaki Sauce
In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the sauce ingredients: 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, and 1 Tbsp sugar.
Microwave the sauce until hot. Mix well to dissolve the sugar and set aside.
To Prepare the Chicken
Place ¾–1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs smooth side down on a cutting board. Now, use the scoring method to create an even thickness so the thighs cook evenly. First, cut slits across the meat every ½ inch (1.3 cm) without slicing all the way through. Note: Do not use a meat mallet/tenderizer for this important step, as you may damage the meat.
Make deeper slits on the chicken‘s thick parts and skip scoring the thin parts. After each cut, press open and flatten the meat with your fingers. In the below images, you can see how I scored (left) and flattened (right) one piece. Once you finish scoring, check again to make sure the thigh has an even thickness. Repeat with the rest of the thighs.
Lightly season the chicken pieces with ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
To Sear the Chicken
Heat a large frying pan over medium to medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot, place the chicken smooth side down in the pan. Note: The bottom side will be the presentation side.
Cook the chicken for 5 minutes (set a timer). Immediately, press down hard on the chicken with a spatula for 5–10 seconds to give the presentation side a nice sear. The right image below shows what the chicken looks like after 5 minutes of cooking; please adjust the time based on your stove and cookware.
Flip over the chicken. Immediately press it down again with the spatula for 5–10 seconds.
Switch to low heat, then cover with a lid and steam the chicken for 3 minutes.
Open the lid. Use a paper towel to wipe the excess grease and protein from the pan. This helps create a more transparent sauce.
To Add the Teriyaki Sauce
Now, increase the stove‘s heat to medium and add the teriyaki sauce to the pan. Tilt the pan and frequently spoon the sauce over the chicken.
When the chicken is well coated with sauce and cooked through, transfer it to a cutting board.
Continue cooking the sauce until it's thick enough to your liking. Then, transfer it to a bowl. Remember to stop cooking while the sauce is slightly thin because the residual heat will continue to thicken the sauce. If you‘d like it thicker, reduce the sauce for 2–3 minutes longer.
Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Transfer them to a ceramic plate. Sear with a kitchen butane torch to enhance the flavor. You can also use a broiler in the oven.
To Serve
Serve on a plate with the sauce drizzled on top. You can also serve it over steamed rice with the sauce drizzled on top, as I did here. I also served green salad and tomato wedges on the side.
To Store
You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for a month.
To Cook Skin-on Chicken Thighs
If your ¾–1 lb skin-on chicken thighs are bone-in, ask your butcher to remove the bone or you can debone them yourself. Place the thigh meat skin side down on a cutting board. To even the thickness, make slits on the meat every ½ inch (1.3 cm) without cutting all the way through. Cut deeper slits on the thick parts and skip scoring the thin parts. As you score, press open the meat to flatten it. Once you finish scoring, check again to make sure the meat has an even thickness. Repeat with the rest of the thighs.
Place the thighs skin side down in a hot frying pan and cook using the same method as described above.

Please note that this recipe requires 7 days of resting time.
Gather all the ingredients. Please weigh your ingredients with a digital kitchen scale. You'll also need 2 mason jars with lids (16 oz. each).
To Peel and Clean the Yuzu
Rinse 2.2 lbs yuzu and dry well with a kitchen towel. Score the rind on the bottom with an X using a sharp knife. This makes peeling easier.
Peel off the rinds with your fingers. The bumpy and loose skin should come off in one piece. Set the rinds aside for now. Then, separate each fruit segment and place them in a large tray. Tip: Work over the tray while you handle the fruit to collect any juice, which you will use later.
Remove any stringy white membrane from the fruit (but leave the membrane wall intact). I collect the stringy membrane and any seeds that fall out in a separate small tray to discard after the next step.
To Remove the Seeds
Cut each segment in half crosswise with kitchen scissors, working over the tray to any collect the juice. Remove the seeds. Place the seeded halves in another large tray.
When you are done, discard the seeds and stringy membrane.
To Slice the Rinds
Remove the stem or ""button"" attached to the rinds. Then, thinly julienne the rinds lengthwise.
Once you finish slicing, add the rinds to the large tray with the seeded fruit. Add any of the collected juice from the other trays.
Then, squeeze and rub everything together until the rinds start to soften.
To Clean the Jars
Divide ½ cup shochu into 2 clean and dry mason jars (16 oz each). Close the lids and shake the alcohol around the inside surfaces of the jar and lid. Then, pour it out and let air dry.
To Prepare the Yuzu Cha
First, fill the bottom of the sterilized jars with a layer of some of the 2.2 lbs white rock sugar. Then, cover the rock sugar with a layer of the yuzu mixture using tongs. Continue alternating the layers until you use all the yuzu.
Along the way, press down on the layers with a spoon to remove any air gaps. End with a layer of rock sugar that completely covers the yuzu.
Wipe the jar rims with a clean kitchen towel dampened with shochu.
Close the lids.
To Make the Yuzu Cha
Keep the jars in a cool place for about 7 days. If you live in a warm climate, store them in a refrigerator. Gently shake and tilt the jars at least once a day to make sure the yuzu is coated with syrup. The goal is to extract the yuzu flavor quickly. If left exposed and uncoated by rock sugar or syrup, the fruit may grow mold and ruin the syrup.If you use granulated sugar instead of white rock sugar, store it in the refrigerator immediately after the sugar has completely dissolved.
To Store
At the end of Day 7, move the jars into the fridge, where you can keep them for up to 1–2 months.

Shokupan Loaf Pans: The rectangular loaf pan is 4.7 x 7.8 x 5.1 in. (12 x 20 x 13 cm) and can hold approx 2900 ml. The square loaf pan is 4.7 x 5.3 x 5.1 in. (12 × 13.5 × 13 cm) and can hold approx 1900 ml. I have written an extensive post about Japanese loaf pans and how to order them from Japan. If you‘re not particular about the size and shape, you can use this 1 lb loaf pan on Amazon and follow the recipe for the rectangular loaf.
Stand Mixer: Please note that my instructions below are for a KitchenAid 5-QT Artisan Series stand mixer (325 watts). If you‘re using a KitchenAid Classic Series mixer, do not double the recipe as the 275-watt motor is not strong enough. If you‘re using a KitchenAid Professional Series mixer with a spiral hook, you must double the rectangular loaf recipe to succeed, as there won‘t be enough dough to engage the hook otherwise. With twice the dough, you must knead 1.5 times longer at each step (as noted in the instructions). If you have a different brand of stand mixer, follow my steps the best you can to achieve a dough with the correct texture that passes the windowpane test (please see below for how to do this).
Hand Kneading: I hope this video is helpful for the kneading technique to use.
Oven Rack: Set the oven rack to a lower position where the top edge of your loaf pan is 6–7 inches (15–18 cm) away from the top heating element. This will allow enough space for the bread to rise during baking, especially for a round-topped loaf. Don’t get closer than 6 inches or the top may brown too fast.
To Create a Warm Environment for Bulk Fermentation: If your oven has a Proof setting, turn it to 100ºF (38ºC). Otherwise, place small baking dishes of boiling water on the lower-middle rack at the four corners. Then, place your dough in a bowl in the center of the rack and close the door. The steam and heat from the boiling water will create a warm environment for bulk fermentation. You can also proof bread dough with an Instant Pot using the Yogurt function on Low or the temperature setting. During the summer when humidity is high, you may not need to create a special environment.
To Make the Dough
Gather all the ingredients. Precise measurement is extremely important for this recipe; therefore, please weigh your ingredients with a digital kitchen scale. I strongly discourage measuring by volume. Now, cut the butter into small cubes; I used a pair of kitchen shears. For 1 rectangular loaf, use 25 g unsalted butter. (For 1 square loaf, use 17 g unsalted butter.)
In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, salt, and honey: For 1 rectangular loaf, combine 250 g warm water, 20 g sugar, 7 g Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 10 g honey. (For 1 square loaf, combine 167 g warm water, 14 g sugar, 4.5 g Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 7 g honey.) Mix well together. Then, add the yeast: For 1 rectangular loaf, add 7 g instant yeast. (For 1 square loaf, add 4.7 g instant yeast.) Whisk it all together and set aside in a warm place for 10 minutes. You want to see bubbly foam on the surface. Tip: If you don’t see any, maybe your yeast is old or the environment is not warm enough; wait another 5 minutes to see if any foamy bubbles develop.
Meanwhile, combine the bread flour and dry milk powder in a stand mixer bowl: For 1 rectangular loaf, combine 350 g bread flour and 20 g skim milk powder or nonfat dry milk powder. (For 1 square loaf, combine 235 g bread flour and 14 g skim milk powder or nonfat dry milk powder.) Mix it together. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture.
Once you confirm the foamy surface on the yeast mixture, pour it into the well of the flour mixture, scraping out every bit of the liquid with a silicone spatula or dough scraper. Then, mix it until combined. Keep this yeast mixture bowl, as you’ll put the dough ball in it later.
To Knead the Dough in the Stand Mixer
Warning: KitchenAid does not recommend kneading dough at settings higher than Speed 2. However, we can’t achieve a perfect texture without kneading aggressively. Hold your stand mixer down with your hand(s) when you’re kneading at Speed 6, and keep an eye on the mixer at all times. Do not walk away. Don’t take this warning lightly, as my instructor’s mixer fell off the countertop onto the kitchen floor twice when she stepped away for just a few seconds. Please use it at your own discretion.
Set up the stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Knead the dough on Speed 2 for 2 minutes (or 3 minutes for double the rectangular loaf recipe). This is just to get started. The ingredients should be well combined after this step.
Next, increase the speed and knead the dough on Speed 4 for 4 minutes (or 6 minutes for double). Now, stop the mixer. The dough will be smoother than before, yet still a bit rough and bumpy.
Add the butter cubes to the dough. Knead again on Speed 2 for 2 minutes (or 3 minutes for double), or until you no longer see any butter streaks.
Then, knead on Speed 4 for 4 minutes (or 6 minutes for double). While spinning, the dough will stretch and elongate (see the photo below).
Stop the mixer and check the dough's texture. It should be smoother, shinier, softer, and thinner when it’s stretched. At this stage, the dough is still attached to the bottom of the mixer bowl.
Now, knead the dough on Speed 6 for 3 minutes (or 4½ minutes for double). From here, you MUST hold down your stand mixer with your hand(s) since the machine will shake and move and may possibly fall off the countertop.
The dough will start to pull away from the bottom of the bowl and eventually become a solid ball shape. The mixer will shake and wobble as the dough bangs against the sides of the bowl. Again, hold your stand mixer to keep it from falling and monitor it at all times.
Japanese milk bread requires aggressive kneading to get that soft, tender texture. The goal here is to develop the gluten (elasticity) by lengthening and stretching the gluten strands in the dough.
After kneading on Speed 6, stop the mixer. The dough should look really shiny, silky, soft, and smooth (not sticky). When you lift the dough hook, it should pick up all the dough in one piece, separating easily from the bottom of the bowl. Tip: If the dough becomes slack and gooey, you‘ve kneaded the dough too long.
To Use the Windowpane Test
Now, it’s time to try the windowpane test. Pull on a part of the dough or tear off a small piece. Hold the dough in both hands and gently pull it into a square with your fingers. It should be very elastic, smooth, and shiny. If it‘s strong enough to stretch to a super-thin membrane without tearing and light can pass through the center, your dough passes the test. If it doesn’t stretch or it tears too easily, knead it again on Speed 6 for 2–3 minutes and test again.
To check the dough temperature, insert an instant-read thermometer into the center of the dough. It should be 79–82ºF (26–28ºC) and not lower or higher than this. Yeast is most active at 82–95ºF (28–35ºC) during bulk fermentation. Tip: If your dough temperature is higher than 82ºF (28ºC), let it slowly rise for the first rise (bulk fermentation) without using your oven's Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) or placing it in a warm spot. This will help prevent overproofing.
To Slam and Fold
Once your dough passes the windowpane test, lightly dust the work surface and your hands with flour. Scrape the dough from the bowl onto the work surface with the silicone spatula or dough scraper. From this point, make sure to keep one smooth surface on your dough ball at all times. My smooth surface is currently on the bottom of the dough.
Now, pick up the dough ball, keeping the smooth side up. Then, slam the smooth side onto the work surface. Bang!
Then, hold one edge of the dough with your fingers in the 12 o’clock position and fold it over to the opposite side at the 6 o’clock position, revealing the smooth surface. Now, pick up the dough with the smooth side up.
Once again, slam the smooth surface of the dough onto the work surface. Bang! Now, pick up the edge of the dough at the 9 o’clock position and fold it over to the opposite side at the 3 o’clock position, revealing the smooth surface. Again, pick up the dough with the smooth side up.
Repeat this “slam and fold“ process 5 times in total. After you slam the dough for the final time, leave the dough on the work surface temporarily, and don‘t fold it over yet.
Take the bowl that you mixed the yeast in and thinly coat it with ½ tsp neutral oil. Wipe off any excess oil from the bowl and your fingers with a paper towel.
Fold the dough over one last time. Pick it up and pull the edges from all sides to create a smooth, taut skin. Tuck and pinch the edges underneath to hide them at the bottom. Put the dough ball in the bowl and cover it with plastic.
The First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)
Place the bowl in a warm environment and let the dough rise for 40 minutes or until it triples in size. If you live in a cool climate, it may take longer (1–1½ hours). I use the Proof setting on my oven at 100ºF (38ºC). Please see the “Before You Start“ section of the recipe for my proofing tips.
To Use the Finger Test
Once the dough has tripled in size, dust some flour on top and use your index finger to poke the middle of the dough. If the hole does not close up, it’s ready. If the dough closes up immediately, proof the dough a little longer and test again.
To Deflate the Dough
Uncover and invert the bowl to release the dough onto your work surface. Using your fingers, gently press down and deflate the air bubbles in the dough. Remember to keep one smooth surface on your dough at all times. My smooth surface is currently on the bottom of the dough.
Collect and press all the edges into the middle, flip the dough, and form a round shape, tucking any loose edges underneath.
To Divide the Dough
Using a kitchen scale, weigh the dough. Divide it with the dough scraper into 3 equal pieces for a rectangular shokupan loaf (or into 2 equal pieces for a square shokupan loaf).
If you have a piece that‘s bigger than the others, tear off some dough from the edge, keeping the smooth surface intact. Attach it to the edge of a piece that‘s smaller than the others.
Form each piece into a ball with a smooth, taut skin: Hold the dough with the smooth surface on top and gently pull and tighten the dough down from all sides to create tension on the outside. We want all three dough balls to rise equally, so limit the pulling action to roughly the same for each ball, about 3–4 times total. Tuck and pinch the loose dough at the bottom. Place the dough on the work surface and repeat this process for the other pieces. Alternatively, you can place the dough on a non-floured surface. Place both of your hands behind the dough and drag it along the work surface toward your body. The bottom of the dough sticks to the dry surface, creating tension and tightening the ball. Keep the dough ball upright and don't allow the top of the dough to roll over as you pull (see this video). Rotate the ball a quarter turn and perform another gentle drag toward your body. Continue rotating and dragging a few more times until the dough is sufficiently taut and uniformly round.
The Bench Rest
Cover the dough balls with a damp towel and rest them for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, use a pastry brush to grease the pan and the lid (if you‘re making flat-topped shokupan) with a thin coating of 10 g unsalted butter. Tip: I like the taste of butter on the crust, but you can use cooking oil spray instead, if you prefer.
To Shape the Dough into a Rectangle
After 15 minutes, take out one dough ball, keeping the rest under the damp towel. Gently handle the dough without stressing it. Dust just enough flour so your dough does not stick to the work surface and rolling pin, but not so much that your dough slides around. As you practice, you will know how much flour is just enough. Next, place the rolling pin in the middle of the dough and press it down.
First, roll out the dough away from you all the way through the top edge. Rolling releases gas in the dough. Next, roll out the dough toward you all the way through the edge closest to you. Tip: If the dough slides around, you dusted too much flour. I love using a nonstick rolling pin; you can buy a similar one from Amazon.
Pick up the dough and flip it over, and then rotate it 90 degrees so it's laid out in front of you in a horizontal oval shape.
Roll the four corners of the dough to shape the oval into a rectangle. Place the rolling pin in the middle.
Roll out the dough away from you and then toward you, rolling through all the edges.
Next, roll out the upper two corners, so they are squared rather than rounded.
Then, roll out the lower two corners. The dough will now be a vertical rectangle.
Make sure the dough is an even thickness from the edges to the center. Use the heel of your hand around the edges to flatten the thick parts or pop the air bubbles. The rectangle will measure roughly 21 x 26 cm (8 x 10 in.). Tip: I noticed from my own experience that if I don’t roll out the dough evenly at this stage, it affects the shape when I roll up the dough later.
To Make the Dough Rolls
Fold the dough in thirds lengthwise. First, bring the right third of the dough to the left one-third line, lightly and gently pressing the edge down so it stays in place. Next, fold the left third of the dough, overlapping the right third by two-thirds. The edge of the left third should be slightly past the center line. Tip: If the dough sticks to the work surface, detach it gently; do not pull it, or the dough's surface will not be smooth. Always handle your dough gently with care and do not stress the dough.
Press down and seal this edge with your fingers, from top to bottom. At this stage, the folded dough should have an even thickness. Both the right and left horizontal edges are thicker (puffed up), but the overlapped edges near the center even out the thickness of the dough.
Fold down the two upper corners toward the center line, so the top now looks like a triangle tip. Then, tuck the tip down toward you, making sure it is right in the middle.
Start rolling the dough slowly toward you, gently pulling the dough downward as you roll to create a smooth and taut skin, but don‘t roll too tightly. Tip: Use the same amount of tension when making all of your dough rolls. This helps them rise at the same rate during the final proof and for an ideal round-topped shokupan shape.
Keep rolling all the way to the end, making sure the shape of the roll is even. Now, pinch the dough edge to seal. Place the rolled-up dough under the damp towel and repeat rolling up the rest of the dough balls. Remember which piece of dough you rolled last.
To Fill the Shokupan Mold
Now, place the dough rolls in the greased shokupan mold, starting with the first two pieces you rolled. Place the first dough roll, seam side down, on one side of the mold. Make sure that 1) the seam is on the bottom, 2) the direction of the swirl goes toward (not away from) the middle of the pan, and 3) the roll's side touches the pan‘s side.
Now, place the second dough roll on the opposite end of the mold, seam side down. Again, the direction of the swirl should go toward the loaf‘s center.
Finally, place the last piece of dough you rolled between the first two, seam side down. The direction of the swirl can go either way. Gently press down on the tops of the dough rolls to make them the same height.
If you are using the square shokupan loaf pan, the two rolls should go in just like the first two rolls for the rectangular loaf pan, swirled toward the center.
The Final Rise (Proofing) and Oven Preheat
Cover the mold with plastic and place in a warm environment for 1 hour or until the dough has risen to 80–90% of the height of the mold, depending on which shape of loaf you're making (see the next step). Tip: For the first 30 minutes, I use the Proof mode of my oven. I then place the mold in a warm area of my house to finish proofing.When you have 30 minutes of proofing time left, start preheating the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the baking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Tip: My oven usually preheats in 15 minutes; however, it is very important that the oven is thoroughly preheated, so I plan 30 minutes of preheating time.
To make a flat-topped shokupan (角型食パン), let the dough rise to 75–80% of the height of the mold. Then, remove the plastic and close the lid. If your proof was a bit too long and you exceed 80%, change to a round-topped shokupan. Tip: Don‘t force the lid closed over the dough. Even if the lid closes, the dough will continue to rise in the oven and the lid will get stuck.
To make a round-topped shokupan (山型食パン), let the dough rise to 85–90% of the height of the mold. When the highest point of the dough touches the plastic wrap, it’s ready to bake. Now, remove the plastic and spritz the surface of the dough with water. Note: The volume for each shokupan mold is very different. My 90% may not be the same as yours if we use a different mold.
To Bake the Shokupan
For the flat-topped shokupan, lower the oven temperature to 415ºF (210ºC) and bake for 25–30 minutes (in my oven, it’s 28 minutes). For the round-topped shokupan, lower the oven temperature to 385ºF (195ºC) and bake for 30 minutes. For a convection oven, reduce the baking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). For a square loaf, the baking temperature and time should be the same or slightly less.
If you bake two loaves at the same time, bake 1–2 minutes longer and make sure to have plenty of space between the pans so the heat can circulate. Tip: If the loaf comes out lighter in color, you may also want to increase the oven temperature by 5ºF (2–3ºC) next time. To bake both the flat-topped and the round-topped shokupan together, bake at 400ºF (200ºC).
When it’s done baking, drop the mold firmly 1–2 times on the work surface (I use a stovetop grate) to allow the water vapors to escape from the bread. This keeps the shokupan from shrinking. Tip: If water vapor remains in the bread, it will weaken the bread‘s structure and make it easier to deflate. The sides of the loaf will wilt and bend as well.
For the flat-topped shokupan, open the lid carefully. If you struggle to remove the lid, close it and drop the shokupan mold on the work surface one more time. If you still can’t open it, note that you need to stop the second proof earlier next time. Maybe instead of 80%, try 75%.
Give a few thrusts and slide the shokupan out of the mold onto a wire cooling rack. After baking, do not wash your Japanese shokupan loaf pan. Simply wipe it off with a paper towel and store it completely dry to prevent rust.
To Serve
Let the shokupan cool completely on the wire rack; it may take 2–3 hours. Do not cut or open the loaf while it’s hot; the steam will escape and the bread will lose moisture. Slice the cooled bread and toast it to enjoy with butter and jam/honey or use untoasted slices for Japanese-style sandwiches.
To Store
If you plan to eat the shokupan within 1 to 2 days, put the whole loaf, completely cooled, in a bag (I use clear plastic bags) and slice as needed. If you don‘t plan to eat the shokupan within 2 days, slice and freeze the rest.

Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut 2 green onions/scallions into 2-inch (5 cm) lengths. Peel the ginger knob and thinly cut about 5 slices ginger.
Trim off the excess fat and the white, stringy connective tissue (tendons) from 2 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs.
Score the flesh to open up the meat, cutting the connective fibers at ½-inch (1.5-cm) intervals, especially on the thickest parts. Then, gently pound the flesh with the back of your knife to flatten and make rolling easier. Fill any empty spots with trimmed pieces of meat to create a more even surface.
To Roll the Chicken
Turn the chicken sideways (90 degrees) and start rolling tightly from the bottom edge. Roll parallel to the direction that you scored the meat; the skin is now on the outside.
Tie the roulade snugly with butcher twine. For the best shape, don't tie it too tightly. Don't tie it too loosely, either, or your roll will fall apart. You can use your favorite method; below are two ways.
Method 1: Tie one end with twine and make a knot; loop and tie it twice more to secure. Then, wrap the twine around the roll, spacing each wrap ½ inch (1.5 cm) apart. Tuck the twine around the last wrap a few times instead of tying it. Method 2: Cut and tie several pieces of twine around the roll crosswise, spacing each ½ inch apart. I like to tie a final piece of twine lengthwise to finish.
To Cook
Preheat a pot just big enough to hold the chicken rolls over medium-low heat. Then add 2 tsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot, place the rolled chicken in the pot, seam side down.
Sear the skin without moving it for about 2 minutes until the seam is set. Occasionally, carefully roll the chicken without tearing the skin.
Sear until all sides are evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and use a paper towel to wipe away any excess fat.
Pour 1 cup water into the pot and gently scrape the browned bits off the bottom using a wooden spatula.
Add ½ cup mirin, ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup sake, and 2 Tbsp sugar.
Stir the seasonings with the spatula. Add the ginger slices and green onion.
Bring it to a boil over medium heat.
Once boiling, cover with a lid and simmer over medium-low heat for about 7–8 minutes.
Remove the lid and flip the chicken. Now, place a drop lid called otoshibuta on the meat. See my What is Otoshibuta post to learn why we use it and how to make one at home; or you can buy one on Amazon. Simmer for an additional 6–7 minutes (you don't need to cover with the pot's lid).
Increase the heat to medium-high and continue simmering, basting the chicken with the sauce until it thickens and develops a glossy glaze, about 5 minutes.
Remove the ginger and green onion.
To Marinate Overnight
Transfer the chicken and all the braising liquid to a storage container.
Let it cool, cover, and refrigerate overnight to allow the chicken to soak up the sauce for the best flavor. I like to add peeled boiled eggs to the marinade to make ramen eggs.
To Serve
After 8 hours, remove from the marinade and cut off the twine with kitchen shears.
Cut the chicken chashu roll crosswise into ½-inch (1.5-cm) slices. For the best flavor, I like to sear the surface with a culinary butane torch until lightly charred. Serve as is, as a ramen topping, or in a rice bowl with heated braising sauce drizzled on top.
To Store
Transfer the chicken chashu and eggs out of the marinade to a new airtight container. You also can save the marinade in a separate jar or container to drizzle on your chashu rice bowl. Store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days or up to 1 month in the freezer. Defrost overnight in the fridge before reheating.

Gather all the ingredients. I usually put the thinly sliced beef in the freezer for 10 minutes because it‘s a lot easier to cut semi-frozen meat.
To Prepare the Ingredients
First, thinly slice ½ onion.
Next, cut 1 green onion/scallion diagonally into thin slices. Set aside.
Then, remove ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) from the freezer. Cut the semi-frozen meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.
In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Stir to combine and dissolve the sugar.
Next, add the onion slices and spread them in the broth throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.
Then, distribute the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.
To Cook
Cover the pan with a lid. Now, turn on the heat to medium and start cooking. Once simmering, turn down the heat to simmer and cook, covered, for 3–4 minutes.
While simmering, open the lid and skim off the scum and fat from the broth once or twice with a fine-mesh skimmer (find it on Amazon and JOC Goods).
Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. Optional: If you would like to add beaten eggs, you can do it now (refer to my Tanindon recipe for detailed instructions).
To Serve
Divide 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice into large donburi bowls. Then, drizzle some of the pan sauce on top of the rice.

See how to cook short-grain rice with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe.
To Caramelize the Onions
Cut 2 onions into thin slices.
Preheat a large heavy-bottomed pot (I used a 5.5 QT Staub Dutch oven) on medium heat. When the pot is hot, add half of the 2 Tbsp unsalted butter, half of the 2 Tbsp neutral oil, and the onions to the pot. Stir to coat the onions.
Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, for about 20–25 minutes. Meanwhile, move on to the next step (but stir the onions and keep an eye on them). When the onions are wilted, reduce the stove‘s heat to medium low (as they tend to burn quickly) and keep cooking. Once the onions are tender, translucent, and a bit caramelized, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until the beef is done searing.
To Prepare the Other Ingredients
While the onions are sautéing, peel and cut 1 russet potato in thirds.
Then, cut each piece in half or quarters. To remove the starch, soak the potato pieces in a bowl of water for 15 minutes or until it's time to add them to the pot later on.
Peel and cut 1 carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter turn between slices to make random cuts. We call this cutting technique rangiri in Japanese.
Clean 6 cremini mushrooms and cut them into thin slices. Tip: I use a pastry brush and avoid washing mushrooms as they absorb moisture. However, it‘s okay to quickly rinse them.
Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure ½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice). Set aside. Then, mince 1 clove garlic (I skip it here as I use a garlic press later).
Cut 1¼ lb boneless beef chuck roast into 1½-inch (3.8 cm) cubes. Tip: I recommend chuck roast for its tenderness and higher quality. While stew beef is slightly more economical, I don't recommend it because it‘s made up of bits and pieces leftover from carving various cuts, so the meat is not as tender.
Lightly sprinkle the beef with ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper. Then, lightly coat the meat on all sides with 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour).
To Sear the Beef
Preheat a carbon steel pan or cast iron skillet on medium-high heat. When it's hot, add the remaining half of the oil and butter. Cook the beef in 2 batches. Add the beef cubes in a single layer, making sure not to crowd the skillet; otherwise, the excess moisture in the pan will end up steaming the meat.
Sear the beef cubes (do not move them) on one side until brown and crusty, about 3–4 minutes, then turn them over to sear the other sides. The meat will release itself from the pan when the surface is seared nicely. Transfer the seared meat to a plate and work on the next batch.
Once you‘ve seared and transferred all the meat, deglaze the pan. Add ½ cup red wine to the pan and use a wooden blunt-end spatula to scrape and release the flavorful browned bits (the “fond“) that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and set aside.
To Cook the Curry
By now, the onions should be caramelized and ready for the next step. Reheat the pot with the onions on the stove over medium heat. Add the minced garlic (I use a garlic press) and grated ginger.
Add ½ Tbsp Japanese curry powder and 1 Tbsp tomato paste and sauté for 1 minute.
Add the seared beef, any juices from the plate, and the deglazed pan liquid to the pot and mix them all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, letting the alcohol from the wine evaporate.
Add the carrots and mushrooms and mix them all together. Add 4 cups beef stock/broth (or half stock/half water) to just cover the ingredients. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring it to a boil. Tip: Compared to Le Creuset, I think Staub lids create a great seal that prevents evaporation.
Once boiling, skim off the scum from the broth's surface. I add water to a 2-cup measuring cup and dip my fine-mesh skimmer in it to rinse off the debris. For full instructions, see my post How To Skim Off the Scum and Fat from Soups and Stocks.
Grate ⅛ apple and add it to the broth. Then, add 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 2 Tbsp milk.
Add 1 bay leaf and cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid. Simmer on low heat until the meat is tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. If you do not have a tight-fitting lid, you may need to add more beef stock or water, enough to just cover the ingredients. Tip: To get tender beef, 2 hours of simmering is standard.
When the beef is tender, add the potatoes, close the lid, and simmer for 15 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through.
When the potatoes are tender (and a wooden skewer can pierce through the potato), discard the bay leaf and turn off the heat.
Add up to 1 package Japanese curry roux off the heat. Put 1–2 cubes of roux in a ladleful of cooking liquid, dissolve it with a spoon or chopsticks, and stir it into the broth to incorporate. Repeat with the remaining roux. Taste as you go and adjust the amount; you may not need to use all of the roux (you can refrigerate or freeze the extra for another use). After adding the curry roux, simmer on the lowest heat, stirring often, for 3–5 minutes until the sauce thickens. Be careful not to burn the sauce! If it‘s too thick, add water to dilute. If it‘s too thin and soupy, uncover the pot and simmer a bit longer.
To Serve
Serve the cooked Japanese short-grain rice on one half of individual plates or shallow bowls. Spoon the beef curry on the other half. Top with optional fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables) and rakkyo (Japanese pickled scallion).
To Store
Keep the leftovers in an airtight glass container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so remove them before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it. If you have any extra roux, keep it in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator or freezer for 1–3 months.
To Reheat
Leftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,

Please note that this recipe requires a cooling time of approximately 1–2 hours and a chilling time of at least 4–6 hours (or overnight) after baking to achieve the perfect creamy yet light texture and balanced flavor. I encourage you to read the blog post for more detailed information that I shared about this recipe.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Use a 9-inch (23-cm) cake pan that is 4 inches (10 cm) high. Cut parchment paper to line the bottom and sides of the cake pan. Cut one circle 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter for the bottom and one rectangular strip 4 x 30 inches (10 x 76 cm) for the sides of the cake pan. In addition, cut two strips of paper 2 x 30 inches (5 x 76 cm) each. We will use these as “straps” to lift the baked cake from the pan.
With 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, grease the cake pan and the parchment paper on one side (for the bottom and the sides so the greased sides will touch the cake batter). You don‘t need to use all the butter.
Crisscross the two parchment paper straps on the bottom of the cake pan so they form an “X.” Allow the excess paper to hang over the sides. Then, line the bottom and sides with the parchment paper so the greased sides will touch the cake pan. The greased side of the paper circle should face down, and the greased side of the rectangular strip should face toward the pan.
To Preheat the Oven and Prepare a Double Boiler
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Note: You will be baking at 320ºF (160ºC). However, we’ll preheat a bit higher because your oven will lose some heat when you open it to place the cheesecake inside.
Prepare a double boiler: Set a medium saucepan filled with 2 inches (5 cm) of water over high heat and bring it to a simmer, then cover and reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer.
To Gather the Ingredients
Gather all the ingredients. It is very important to measure all your ingredients before starting. Separate 6 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into yolks and whites and place the egg whites back in the refrigerator. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the Metric button above to convert the measurements to metric. If you don't have a scale, here's how to measure flour with a measuring cup: Fluff the flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into the measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
To Make the Cake Batter
In a large bowl, add 10.6 oz cream cheese, 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, 200 ml heavy (whipping) cream, and 4½ Tbsp sugar. Rest the bowl on the saucepan above the simmering water. Tip: The double boiler will warm up and soften the cream cheese and butter, so you don't need to bring these ingredients to room temperature ahead of time.
Mash the cream cheese and butter with a silicone spatula. Once they are softened, use a hand whisk to blend everything together. Remove the bowl from the heat.
Whisk the egg yolks, one at a time, into the warm cream cheese mixture. Make sure each yolk is blended well with the cream cheese mixture before adding the next one.
Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift ⅔ cup cake flour into the batter. Whisk and blend together.
Then, pass the batter through the same fine-mesh strainer into a clean large bowl. This creates a silky texture for the batter.
Add the zest of ½ lemon into the batter. Make sure you only zest the flavorful yellow part and not the bitter white pith. Into a separate small bowl, squeeze the juice from the lemon. Measure 2 Tbsp lemon juice and add it to the batter. Whisk well to blend and set aside.
To Set Up the Bain-Marie (Water Bath)
Put a large baking sheet inside the preheating oven and pour in hot water until it is halfway up the sides or ½ inch deep. Close the oven door.
To Beat and Incorporate the Egg Whites
Add the cold egg whites into the dry, clean mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Make sure there is no oil or water in the bowl. If you have space in your refrigerator, I highly recommend keeping the mixing bowl cold until you’re ready to use it. Start whisking on medium speed (Speed 4) until the egg whites become opaque, foamy, and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Then, slowly add ½ cup sugar, one-third of it at a time, while the mixer runs.
Once you’ve added all the sugar, increase the mixer speed to high (Speed 8–9) and beat the egg whites until you have firm peaks. When you lift the whisk and turn it over, the egg whites should cling to the whisk and hold their shape fairly well, but the tip of the peak should fold back on itself.
Using a hand whisk, mix one-third of the egg whites into the cream cheese mixture until incorporated. Then, gently fold another one-third into the mixture.
Lastly, pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl with the last one-third of the egg whites still in it. Fold very gently until just combined.
Pour the batter into the cake pan all at once, avoiding air pockets while pouring. Tap the cake pan a few times on the kitchen counter to release any air pockets in the batter.
To Bake the Cheesecake
Open the oven and place the cake pan onto the baking sheet with the bain-marie. Reduce the oven temperature to 320ºF (160ºC)—25ºF (15ºC) lower for a convection oven—and bake for 70–75 minutes. Then, reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºC) and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. To test for doneness, open the oven door slightly and insert a skewer into the cake. If the skewer comes out without wet batter, it‘s done. Leave the cake inside the oven.
To Cool
Turn off the oven and leave the oven door slightly ajar for 15–20 minutes with the cake inside so it cools gradually. If you immediately remove the cake pan to the kitchen counter, the sudden change in temperature could cause the soufflé cheesecake to collapse. While cooling in the oven, you want the cake to slowly shrink down to half its height, from roughly 4 inches to 2 inches high. After 15–20 minutes, remove the cake pan from the oven.
Gently lift out the cheesecake from the pan using the two parchment paper straps (with help from another set of hands). Place the cake on a plate.
Remove the parchment paper from around the sides (but leave the bottom paper). Combine 2 Tbsp apricot jam and 2 tsp hot water in a small bowl. Brush the apricot glaze over the top of the cheesecake. Let cool to room temperature.
To Serve
Allow the cheesecake to cool completely in the refrigerator for at least 4–6 hours or overnight. Chilled cheesecake has a creamy yet light texture, with a perfectly balanced flavor.If you prefer a softer texture, take the cheesecake out of the fridge about 10–15 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to mellow and the texture to become even fluffier.
To Slice
Use a clean, sharp knife dipped in warm water and wipe clean between slices to ensure neat and tidy cuts, as soufflé cheesecake can be quite delicate.
To Store
You can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days or in the freezer for 3–4 weeks. Thaw the cake overnight in the refrigerator. The cold cheesecake is dense, so leave it on the counter until just chilled before serving.",en,True,"[""American"", ""Italian"", ""French""]",False,True,

DO NOT use scaling (x 2 or x 3) for this recipe.
How much rice to cook depends on the kind of sushi you make. One thick sushi roll (futomaki) requires 1⅔ cups (250 g) of sushi rice. One medium sushi roll (chumaki) like Vegetarian Sushi Roll requires 1 cup (150 g) of sushi rice. One thin sushi roll (hosomaki) requires ½ cup (80 g) of sushi rice. One inside-out sushi roll (uramaki) like California Roll requires ¾ cup (110 g) sushi rice. One nigiri sushi requires 20 g of sushi rice.
How to Measure Rice: Overfill a ¾ cup measuring cup or a plastic rice cooker cup with uncooked short-grain white rice and level it off. Put the measured rice in a large bowl. Repeat until you have the amount you need. Tip: You must use Japanese short-grain white rice or your sushi will fall apart.
Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Wash the Rice
Quick Rinse: Add just enough water to the bowl to submerge the rice, then pour off the water immediately. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so discarding this water right away helps rinse off impurities while keeping the rice from absorbing the first few rounds of milky water.
Wash: With your fingers, gently agitate the wet grains in a circular motion for 10–15 seconds. Tip: Using very little water allows the grains to rub against each other and reduces the absorption of impurities.
Rinse: Add water and immediately discard the cloudy water. Repeat Wash and rinse (steps 2 and 3) two more times.
Drain: When the water is almost clear, drain the rice thoroughly. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off any excess water.
To Soak and Cook the Rice
Put the well-drained rice in the inner pot of a rice cooker and add the measured amount of water. If your rice cooker has a Sushi Rice mode, add water up to the line for how many rice cooker cups of rice you're cooking. If not, use the White Rice mode and add water to just under that line. Tip: Use 1 part rice to 1 part water for sushi rice—less liquid than for regular steamed rice—to account for absorbing the seasoned sushi vinegar later.
Check the piece of kombu for dirt particles. If you see any, use a damp cloth to gently wipe them off (this is the traditional method, but kombu is fairly clean these days). Do not wipe off the white powdery substance that contributes to the umami flavor, and NEVER wash kombu! Now, place the kombu on top of the rice in the pot.
Let the rice soak in the water for 20–30 minutes, then start cooking. If you don‘t have a rice cooker, cook the rice in a pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe with the same amount of water I specified in this recipe.
To Make the Homemade Sushi Vinegar (Optional)
If you are not using store-bought sushi vinegar (seasoned rice vinegar), follow this step. Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan.
Heat it over medium-high heat until it's nearly simmering, whisking until the sugar is dissolved. Alternatively, you can heat the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute or until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to let it cool.
To Season the Rice
Moisten a wooden sushi oke (called hangiri) with running water, drain, and dry it with a clean towel. You can also use a large salad bowl or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tip: This wooden tub helps absorb excess moisture whereas a ceramic bowl cannot.
When the rice is done cooking, discard the used kombu (or repurpose it to make simmered kombu).
Transfer the hot cooked rice to the sushi oke. Spread out the rice evenly so it will cool faster.
While the rice is hot, pour the sushi vinegar over it.
With a rice paddle, gently “slice” the rice at a 45-degree angle to incorporate the vinegar mixture and separate the rice chunks. Do not use a stirring or mixing motion because the grains may break and make the rice mushy. At the same time, vigorously fan the rice with a paddle fan or another type of fan to cool it. Fanning wicks away the excess moisture and makes the rice shine.
Gently flip the rice after every few slices.
Repeat this process until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin. Your sushi rice is now ready to use in your favorite sushi recipes.
To Keep
Cover the sushi rice with a damp towel (or paper towel) and keep it at room temperature for up to a few hours. To store it longer, see below.
To Store
Rice gets hard and dry in the refrigerator from the cold air. Therefore, I recommend freezing the leftover sushi rice in an airtight container for up to a month. When you're ready to use it, defrost the frozen rice overnight in the fridge, then bring it to room temperature (not hot) in the microwave. If you really want to refrigerate it, cover the container with a thick kitchen towel, so the rice will stay cool but not become cold.",en,True,"[""Japanese"", ""Indigenous"", ""Fusion""]",True,True,

I encourage dividing the baking process into morning and afternoon or two days (chilling overnight) to minimize the waiting periods. Gather all the ingredients. Allow the unsalted butter to soften to room temperature for 1 hour or longer. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the measurements. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need.
You will also need a hand or stand mixer with whisk (and paddle) attachments or food processor, an aluminum baking sheet, 2 resealable (Ziplock) sandwich-size bags (about 6 x 6.5 inches, 15 x 16.5 cm), a rolling pin, and rolling pin guides (optional; I bought my acrylic rolling guides from Amazon).
To Mix the Cookie Dough
Separate the egg yolk from the egg white.
Place the egg white in a small bowl, cover with plastic, and store it in the refrigerator. Place ½ large egg yolk in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Tip: To divide the yolk in half for one batch, I use a digital scale to weigh the egg yolk and calculate the precise weight of half.
Place 7 Tbsp unsalted butter (at room temperature) in a bowl and press it with a silicone spatula until smooth. Add ½ cup confectioners’ sugar.
Blend well with an electric mixer until the mixture turns fluffy and pale. Tip: Whipping the butter and sugar mixture adds air, and this makes the cookies crispier.
Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and blend until incorporated.
Then, add ½ large egg yolk and continue mixing until smooth.
Add 2 Tbsp almond flour and blend it until fully incorporated and smooth.
With the silicone spatula, scrape down the bowl to collect the dough.
Now, weigh the dough in a clean bowl over a kitchen scale (I use a digital kitchen scale). Weigh the total amount and divide it in half. My batch of dough is roughly 180 g, so each half weighed about 90 g. Place each half in separate bowls, one to make the plain dough and the other to make the green matcha dough.
To Make the Plain Dough
Sift ½ heaping cup cake flour into the bowl for the plain dough.
Lightly mix with the spatula, gently folding the flour into the dough until just incorporated. Do not overmix.
Once crumbly, press the dough together, shaping it into a ball and scraping the sides.
Put the dough ball in a plastic resealable (ziplock) sandwich bag. Set aside.
To Make the Green Matcha Dough
Using a hand whisk, mix 5 tsp matcha (green tea powder) into ½ cup cake flour until well incorporated. Tip: Pre-mixing makes it easier to blend in.
Sift the matcha-flour mixture into the bowl with the other half of the dough.
Gently fold the flour mixture into the dough with the spatula until just incorporated. Do not overmix.
When crumbly, press it into a cohesive dough ball and put it in a plastic resealable sandwich bag.
To Roll Out the Dough Balls
Release the air from the sandwich bag, seal, and roll the dough ball flat with a rolling pin.
If you're using the rolling guides, place them on either side of the bag and roll flat. You could stack two disposable chopsticks (or something similar) as rolling guides. However, my recipe should work perfectly to completely fill the sandwich bags with cookie dough to a 5-mm thickness without the use of rolling guides.
Using the rolling pin, evenly flatten the dough to 5 mm thick and about 6 x 6½ inches (15 x 16.5 cm) in size.
Repeat rolling out the matcha dough using the same method.
Roll out gently so the dough doesn't come out of the sealed bag. Now, place the bags of flattened dough in the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour.
To Assemble the Checkered Logs
Remove the chilled and firm dough from the fridge. Using a sharp knife, cut open the left and right sides of one sandwich bag. Repeat with the other bag. Tip: Make sure your chilled dough feels solid before you begin. As the dough warms, it will soften. If the dough becomes too soft to handle, wrap it in plastic and refrigerate until firm. Then, continue with the recipe.
Peel back the tops of the sandwich bags to uncover the dough, leaving the bags on the bottom as is.
Lightly brush the matcha dough surface with beaten egg white. Pick up the plain dough with its plastic bag, then flip the plain dough onto the matcha dough. Apply gentle pressure to adhere. Then, peel away the plastic bag from the plain dough.
Cut this layered dough in half. Brush one half with egg white.
Matching the clean-cut sides, stack the other half on top so you have four layers of alternating colors. Apply gentle pressure to adhere.
Measure and mark 1-cm intervals (just over ⅜ inch) with the tip of your knife along the top and bottom edges of the dough stack. These are cutting marks that you will use in the next step. I use a pastry board with measurements, but I highly recommend using a ruler here.
Using the cutting marks as a guide, slice straight down with a knife to make long, layered strips that are each 1 cm thick. I was able to cut eight strips. Tip: Your dough strips might warm up and soften. If this happens, wrap them in plastic, place on a tray, and refrigerate until firm. Then, try again.
Lay three strips flat on your work surface so you can see the colored layers of dough. Flip over the middle strip so the order of the colors is reversed from the left and right strips; see how it should look in the image below. Make a dough log with the three strips: First, brush egg white on the tops of the strips that will become the bottom and middle of your log (you don't have to brush the top strip). Then, stack the three strips to form a log. You can look at one end of the log to confirm you see a checkered pattern. Finally, press gently to adhere the strips without misshaping the log.
Stack three more strips into a second log. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Tip: If you want to freeze the dough logs to slice and bake at a later time, please see the To Store section for instructions.
For the leftover two strips, I simply roll them into a ball, then roll it into a log. Alternatively, you could cut the strips in half crosswise and stack them to make short checkered logs. Either way, wrap the leftover dough log in plastic and chill.
To Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Slice the chilled dough logs into cookies ¼ inch (7 mm) thick.
Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 13–15 minutes, or until slightly browned on the bottom.
The residual heat will brown the cookies more, so remove them from the oven when they are just a tad golden. Cool for 5-10 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer the cookies to a wire cooling rack.
Continue slicing and baking the leftover cookie dough. Tip: When you slice the dough log, rotate it to maintain the circle shape.
Serve with your favorite beverage and enjoy!

Tip: For the sauce, I recommend doubling the recipe, just in case you need extra. If you end up adding more ingredients, you‘ll need more sauce so the yakisoba noodles are flavorful.
To Make the Yakisoba Sauce
Whisk together the sauce ingredients: 3 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 4 tsp oyster sauce, 3 tsp ketchup, 2 tsp soy sauce, and 2 tsp sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Tip: It‘s important to taste the sauce now and add more sugar, if needed. For example, some ketchup is sweeter than others while some Worcestershire sauce is less sour than others. Set it aside.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Peel and devein 5 oz shrimp. Cut 2 oz squid into bite-size strips. Place the seafood in a bowl and toss with 2 Tbsp sake to marinate. Set aside to marinate.
Cut ½ onion into ¼-inch (6-mm) slices.
Cut 4 inches carrot into 2-inch slabs. Then, cut them into julienne strips 2 inches (5 cm) long.
Remove the tough core from ½ lb green cabbage. Cut the cabbage leaves into slices 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Then, cut the slices into bite-sized pieces.
Chop 3 green onions/scallions into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Cut any thick, white parts of the green onions in half lengthwise. Keep the green and white parts in separate piles.
Place the 3 servings yakisoba noodles on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Heat in the microwave to steam, then loosen the noodles with your hands.
To Cook the Shrimp Yakisoba
Heat a griddle, large wok, or large skillet on medium-high heat, then add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot, add the sliced onions and white part of scallions. Sauté, tossing occasionally with a pair of tongs, allowing the onions to char on the edges and soften a bit. When they start to become translucent, push them one the side of the griddle. Add the shrimp in a single layer to an empty space on the cooking surface.
Add the squid pieces next to the shrimp in a single layer. Quickly sear the seafood, flipping the shrimp when it turns opaque and pan-grilling the squid until its juices evaporate on the griddle. Remove the seafood to a tray.
Add the cabbage and carrot to the cooking onions and toss together. Cook the vegetables while tossing occasionally, leaving them to grill and brown on the hot cooking surface and develop a golden char. When the cabbage is slightly softened but still crisp, spread out the vegetables across the griddle. Add the cooked seafood and green part of the scallions across the top.
Spread out the loosened noodles across the top of the vegetables and seafood. Then, pour the yakisoba sauce on top of the noodles.
Toss to combine the noodles, seafood, and vegetables and distribute the sauce evenly. Lower the heat, if needed. Taste and add more sauce, if desired. Toss and turn off the heat.
To Serve
Transfer the shrimp yakisoba to individual plates. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper to taste and top with optional aonori (dried green laver seaweed) and pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga). Enjoy!

For making onigiri, please use hot, freshly cooked Japanese short-grain rice. See how to cook it with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe.
To make the tuna salad, drain ½ (5-ounce) can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil). Transfer to a bowl and break up the tuna chunks into small flakes. Add 1 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and ¼ tsp soy sauce Mix well to combine.
To Shape the Onigiri
Let the freshly cooked 2¼ cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice cool slightly in a large bowl or tray so it's easier to handle. The rice should be hot or warm when making onigiri.
Method 1: Using an Onigiri Mold
To keep the rice from sticking to it, wet an onigiri mold and lid in a bowl of water and shake off the excess water. Sprinkle salt in the moistened mold. Fill it halfway with rice, making sure to tuck the rice into the corners.
To the center, add a spoonful of tuna mayo filling (about 1–2 tsp). Add more rice to cover the tuna mayo and fill the mold to the top edge.
Sprinkle the top of the rice with a bit more salt. Cover with the lid and push down firmly. You should feel a slight resistance as you compress the rice; if not, add a bit more.
Remove the lid, flip the mold over, and push the “button” to release the rice ball onto a plate. Repeat to make the remaining onigiri. Tip: Dip your fingers in water before touching the onigiri to keep the rice from sticking to them.
Method 2: Using Plastic Wrap
Place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl or any small bowl and sprinkle it with Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Add about ⅓ cup rice. Tip: Salting the rice helps to preserve it longer.
Create a small indentation in the center of the rice, then add a spoonful of tuna mayo, about 1–2 tsp. Add another ⅓ cup rice on top to cover the tuna mayo completely.
Sprinkle the rice with more salt. Gather the corners of the plastic wrap and twist the plastic to tighten it around the rice.
Gently press the rice with your top hand in a ""mountain"" shape to form a triangle corner. At the same time, gently squeeze with your bottom hand to flatten either side. Rotate and press 2–3 more times to form the other triangle corners. Tip: Press firmly enough so the onigiri doesn’t fall apart, but don’t squeeze too tightly. Try to keep the rice ball as airy as possible.
To Wrap with Nori
Cut 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) into thirds. Wrap the onigiri from both sides with a strip of nori seaweed, leaving the top corner exposed. If you like crispy nori, then wait to wrap the onigiri right before serving; keep the nori in an airtight container or bag so it does not get stale in the meantime.
Tuck the nori under the bottom of the onigiri. Place a dollop of tuna mayo filling on the top corner. Serve warm or at room temperature.
To Store
If you‘d like to take onigiri for your lunch, keep it cool in an insulated bag with ice packs and consume within 6 hours. Onigiri gets hard when you refrigerate it and the cold air dries out the rice. So, I don‘t recommend making it too far ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen towels and store it in the fridge. The onigiri will be cool and safe but should not get cold and dry.",en,True,"[""Japanese"", ""Fusion""]",False,False,

Please note that this recipe requires a pre-chilling time of 1–2 hours for the equipment and ingredients to make the pastry dough and a chilling time of 3 hours or overnight for the pastry dough. First, gather all the ingredients. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the Metric button above. If you‘re using a cup measure, please follow the method in my post How to Measure Flour: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
Next, chill your pastry dough ingredients and equipment so they're very cold when you start. Cut the butter into ¾-inch (2-cm) cubes and place them in the freezer. Place the cake flour, powdered sugar, almond flour, salt, and egg in the refrigerator. Finally, place the removable parts of a 3-cup food processor (for one batch; or a stand mixer) in the fridge. Chill everything for at least 1–2 hours.
To Prepare the Pastry Dough
In a food processor (I recommend a 3-cup mini processor for one batch), add ¼ cup unsalted butter and process.
Then, add ½ cup confectioners’ sugar and process until smooth. Alternatively, in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth.
Add 1 large egg yolk and ¼ tsp pure vanilla extract, mixing until incorporated.
Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ¼ cup almond flour and mix until smooth.
Add 1 cup cake flour and process on low.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Keep mixing.
Mix until the butter is fully incorporated. The dough should come together yet be a bit crumbly. If it doesn't, add reserved egg white or more egg yolk to help it bind. Mine is still too fluffy, so I added 1 tsp reserved egg white.
Blend again and check the consistency. I added another 1 tsp of egg white.
Blend and check if the dough comes together. Now, it looks great.
Transfer the dough to a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Press out the air from the bag and seal it.
Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough in the bag to 5 mm (a bit less than ¼ inch) thick. We'll fix the thickness after chilling, so it doesn't have to be perfect at this stage. I placed rolling pin guides (I used acrylic balance rulers) on either side of the bag to help roll it evenly. You could also use wooden rolling pin guides or square-sided disposable chopsticks.
Keep rolling until the dough's a flat and even thickness, filling the bag about three-quarters of the way (to about 8 x 10 inches or 20 x 25 cm). Place the bag on a flat tray or sheet and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight (or freeze for 1 hour if you’re in a hurry).
To Prepare the Cheese Filling
In a large bowl, whisk together ¼ cup sugar and 2 large egg yolks by hand until slightly fluffy, about 1–2 minutes.
Add 1 Tbsp cornstarch and whisk until you have a smooth paste.
In a saucepan, heat 3 Tbsp whole milk, 3 Tbsp heavy cream, 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, and 8 oz cream cheese over low-medium heat. Use a spatula to break up the cream cheese, and once it begins to melt, whisk until smooth. Remove from heat as soon as the ingredients are combined, just before simmering.
Now, temper the egg yolk mixture. Gradually pour the warm cheese mixture into the bowl with the egg yolk mixture while whisking vigorously. The mixture should thicken slightly.
Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring frequently, on medium heat for a few minutes. Stir vigorously for about 1 minute after it begins to boil (you see small bubbles around the edges).
At this stage, the temperature is around 160°F (71°C) and it will start to thicken.
When the mixture has thickened, remove from the heat. Then, add 2 tsp lemon juice, which will loosen and smooth out the mixture a bit. Mix until incorporated.
Pour the cheese filling into a shallow tray or bowl (I used a prep tray from JOC Goods). Level it and smooth the top with a spatula.
Place a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper directly on the surface of the cheese mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Cover the tray or bowl with a lid. Cool to room temperature, then store it in the fridge until ready to use.
To Make the Pastry Shells
Grease the tart molds or muffin pan cups with 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. You don't have to use all the butter.
Place the bag of chilled dough on top of your work surface. I use a Silpat baking liner to prevent sticking. Through the bag, roll the chilled dough again to exactly 5 mm (a bit less than ¼ inch) thick.
Cut the sides of the resealable bag with a knife and peel away the top side, leaving the bottom side in place.
Using a 3.5-inch (9-cm) round cutter, punch out a circle of dough.
Use a knife to cut out a small, pie-shaped wedge (about one-eighth of the circle) from the dough round. This will help the dough fit neatly into the mold. Then, set the dough round on top of a tart mold or muffin cup. While working on the next rounds, the chilled dough will warm up and become a bit more pliable. You don't want to wait too long, either, because the dough will tear easily if it's too warm.
Repeat punching more rounds from the dough, cutting out small wedges, and transferring them on top of the molds.
As soon as the dough rounds look pliable, fit them into the molds to make pastry shells that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. They should slide in easily. Press the dough gently into the corners and smooth the edges. Tip: Don't stretch or extend the dough, which will make the pastry shell too thin. For a typical muffin cup or tart mold, there won't be enough dough to cover the sides all the way up to the top edge. Also, avoid touching on the outer rim of the dough round and ruining its sharp edge and neat appearance.
Re-roll the leftover dough between the sheets of the same plastic bag.
Roll to a thickness of 5 mm (a bit less than ¼ inch) over the plastic so the rolling pin doesn't stick.
Use the cutter to punch out more dough rounds and cut out small wedges.
Re-roll the leftover pieces again.
Repeat until you use all the dough.
Press the pastry dough into the corners and sides of the molds to form the shells to 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. Make the top edges of the shells neat for presentation.
To Blind Bake the Pastry Shells
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Prick the bottom of each tart shell with a fork. Place a parchment liner in each shell, and fill with pie weights.
Repeat with the rest of the shells. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for about 15 minutes.
Take out the muffin pan, remove the liners and pie weights, then return the pan to the oven. Lower the temperature to 320°F (160°C), and bake for 5 more minutes or until set but still pale.
When the shells are set but still slightly pale, remove them from the oven.
Gently lift out the shells from the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Tip: With my thumbs inside the pastry, I apply gently outward pressure to lift them up and transfer them to the cooling rack.
To Assemble and Bake the Cheese Tarts
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). To make the egg wash, beat 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) with a whisk in a small bowl. Add 1 tsp water and whisk again. Set aside.
Remove the cheese filling from the refrigerator. Place a piping tip in a pastry bag and set it over a cup.
Transfer the cheese filling to the piping bag with a spatula.
Pipe the cheese filling into the cooled tart shells. Squeeze the filling into close to the center bottom, staying in that position until it fills up all the way and looks overfilled, and then pull out. If the cheese filling is too firm, let it sit for a bit at room temperature to soften for easier piping.
Set the filled tarts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Brush the egg wash over the surface of each filled tart.
Place the tarts on the upper-middle rack in the oven and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 10–15 minutes.
Rotate the baking sheet halfway through for even coloring. The cheese tarts are done when the surface is dry and turns golden.
Let cool on the wire rack for a few minutes. For the best flavor, enjoy them warm or at room temperature on the same day they’re baked. When chilled in the refrigerator, the filling becomes denser, allowing you to enjoy a texture similar to a Japanese rare cheesecake.
To Store
If you plan to eat the tarts the same day, keep them at room temperature. Cover them lightly with plastic wrap or place them in an airtight container to prevent drying. For longer storage, keep the tarts in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. This will preserve the texture of the filling, giving it a dense, creamy consistency similar to cheesecake. You can also freeze them for up to one month. Wrap each tart individually in plastic wrap, then place them in an airtight container or freezer bag in the freezer. To serve, thaw at room temperature or enjoy them frozen for a texture similar to ice cream.
To Reheat
If you prefer a freshly baked texture, lightly warm refrigerated or thawed tarts in a preheated oven or toaster oven for a few minutes. This will restore the crispy crust and slightly soften the filling.",en,True,,False,True,"JSON parsing failed: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 17 column 55 (char 935)"

I highly encourage you to use metric measurements using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. You will also need a 12-inch nonstick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid. It‘s also nice to have an infrared thermometer gun to check the temperature of the frying pan.
To Make the Fresh Whipped Cream (optional)
If you‘d like to serve the Fluffy Japanese Soufflé Pancakes with optional fresh whipped cream, make it now. First, prepare an ice bath: Put ice cubes and water in a large bowl and place a clean and dry medium bowl on top of the ice water. Add ½ cup heavy (whipping) cream and 1½ Tbsp sugar to the medium bowl to keep them cold.
Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The cream should not be runny but soft, fluffy, and firm instead. Keep the whipped cream chilled until you‘re ready to serve the pancakes.
To Mix the Batter
Separate 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into whites and yolks in two different bowls. Put the bowl with the egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Why do we partially freeze the egg whites? Please read why in my post 2 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites).
In the meantime, add 1½ Tbsp whole milk and ¼ tsp pure vanilla extract to the egg yolks and whisk using a hand whisk until thick and frothy.
Sift ¼ cup cake flour and ½ tsp baking powder into the bowl.
Whisk to combine thoroughly; do not overmix. Set aside while you make the meringue.
To Make the Meringue
After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with the egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now, start beating the egg whites with a hand mixer (you can also use a stand mixer or balloon whisk).
When the egg whites turn frothy and opaque, gradually add in 2 Tbsp sugar, roughly one-third of it at a time. Then, increase the mixer speed to high (Speed 10) and beat vigorously until stiff peaks form (see the next step for how to check). It takes about 2 minutes of beating at high speed to reach stiff peaks. Tip: When using a stand mixer, I usually pause beating when the meringue is almost done. Take off the whisk attachment from the mixer and use it to hand-mix the looser egg whites near the bowl's edge into the stiffer whites near the center until it's all homogenous in texture. Then, put the whisk back on and continue beating.
To check for stiff peaks, stop whisking and pull up your beaters or whisk. The meringue in the bowl or on the whisk should be firm enough to hold a peak, pointing straight up (or maybe folding over a little bit just at the very tips). By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture, too. Tip: If you overbeat the meringue, it will become very stiff and grainy and won't incorporate into the batter at all.
Heat a large nonstick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with 1 Tbsp neutral oil and lightly remove any visible oil with a paper towel (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the pan on low heat while you fold in the egg white meringue into the egg yolk mixture in the next step.
To Fold In the Meringue
Take one-third of the egg white meringue and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together by hand (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this point).
Next, take half of the remaining meringue and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a hand whisk, gently fold them in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites. Why do we use a whisk instead of a silicone spatula? Please read my post 2 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites).
Now, transfer the egg yolk mixture back into the bowl with the remaining meringue. Very gently fold the two mixtures together, taking care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Mix the batter very gently until well combined and homogenous.
To Cook the Pancakes
Keep your nonstick frying pan heated to 300ºF (150ºC) at all times over low heat. Remember, each pancake gets roughly four small scoops of batter, and you will be making three pancakes. For the first pancake, place one scoop of batter and make a tall mound in the frying pan, using a small ladle or a serving spoon (that’s bigger than a regular spoon—probably 2–3 Tbsp). Next, stack one more scoop of batter onto the first scoop already in the pan. Repeat for the next two pancakes, giving each pancake two scoops of batter.
By the time all three pancakes have two scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already. At this point, you can mound one more scoop on top of each pancake, keeping the batter piled up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly three scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).
Set the timer for 6–7 minutes and add 1 Tbsp of the 2 Tbsp water in three empty spaces inside the pan. Cover with a lid. The steam from the water keeps the pancakes moist while they cook. Please note: The suggested time is just a guideline; how long you will cook the pancakes is based on the temperature of your frying pan.
After 2 minutes have passed, open the lid, and add one final scoop of batter to each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack the batter high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with the lid and cook.
After 6–7 minutes have passed, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY using an offset spatula. If the pancake is stuck, don’t touch it until it firms up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake. Repeat with the other pancakes.
Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip it over with a “rolling over” motion.
Add another 1 Tbsp water to the empty spaces in the pan and cover. Set the timer for 4–5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat setting.
Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.
To Serve
Place the optional fresh whipped cream on the pancakes and top with fresh berries. Dust your Fluffy Japanese Soufflé Pancakes with 1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!

Add ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock). Use your chopsticks to press down on the vegetables to submerge them in the cooking liquid.
Add the tender napa cabbage leaves and light green negi leaves to the pan, arranging them in separate sections. Nestle the tofu pieces in the broth in their own section. Add the mushrooms. Cover the pan to simmer for a few minutes.
Check to see if the vegetables are cooked. If not, continue simmering for a few more minutes. When the carrots and napa cabbage are tender, turn off the heat.
To Serve
Serve the cooked Japanese short-grain rice in individual large (donburi) bowls. Transfer the sukiyaki on top of the rice and drizzle it with additional sukiyaki broth, as desired. Garnish with optional pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) and serve immediately.

To Prepare the Chestnuts
Soak 20–25 chestnuts in warm water for at least 30 minutes. Some Japanese recipes use cold water, but I find warm water helps. To keep the chestnuts moist and fragrant, we typically do not boil or roast them before cooking with the rice.
Hold a chestnut in one hand and a pairing knife in the other. Carefully insert the corner of the knife under the bottom of the chestnut where the flat sides meet. Then, peel and remove the entire bottom. Tip: When the shell is tough and stubborn, place the chestnut on the cutting board, cut off the bottom, and then hold it to peel off the shell.
Next, peel off a strip of shell along the side toward the chestnut tip.
You should be able to peel off the outer shell with your fingers. Depending on the chestnut, the outer shell and inner skin may come off together, exposing the yellow flesh. The inner skin is the thin, papery brown layer that adheres to the nut itself.
To create a beautiful presentation, peel away a thin layer of the bumpy chestnut flesh using the pairing knife. It's best to create a few wide, large cuts like the facets of a diamond rather than many small cuts. Soak the peeled chestnuts in a bowl of water for at least 30 minutes, changing the water a few times. Peel and soak the rest of the chestnuts.
This one still has the thin, papery inner skin is still attached. Thinly peel off the bumpy flesh and inner skin together.
Some chestnuts have folds and crevices where the outer shell is wedged. Use the edge of the knife to remove them. After soaking in a few changes of water, the chestnuts are a beautiful color. Tip: If your chestnuts are big, and cut them in half so that they cook evenly.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Put 1⅞ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice and ⅓ cup sweet rice/glutinous rice (mochigome) in a large bowl. Gently wash the rice with cold water and discard the cloudy water. Repeat this process about 3–4 times until the water becomes almost clear. Drain well.
Put the well-drained rice and 2¼ cups water in a heavy-bottomed pot; I used a Hario Gohangama donabe, but you can use a Dutch oven instead. Tip: You can also cook this in a rice cooker.
Add 1 Tbsp sake and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to the pot. Gently mix it all together, then level the rice.
Place the chestnuts on top in a single layer, with the rounded sides facing up. Cover and let it soak for 20 to 30 minutes.
To Cook the Chestnut Rice
Bring the rice to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if the water is boiling (otherwise, do not open the lid). Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed (take a quick peek). If there is still water left, close the lid and continue cooking for a little longer. If you're using the Gohangama, cook on medium-high heat until it starts to whistle, then cook for an additional 1 minute. Tip: If using a rice cooker, simply press Start and cook as usual.
Remove the pot from the heat. Keep the lid on and let the rice steam for 15–20 minutes. This steaming time is a crucial part of the cooking process, so please do not skip it.
To Fluff and Serve
Open the lid and set aside the best-looking chestnuts on a plate for serving.
To fluff the rice, insert a rice paddle vertically into the cooked rice. Turn over a scoop of rice from the bottom. Then, use a slicing motion to separate the grains and gently incorporate the chestnuts. Repeat until fluffed. Serve the rice and top with the reserved chestnuts. Optionally, sprinkle Diamond Crystal kosher salt and toasted black sesame seeds on top.

Please note that this recipe requires a marination time of 2–3 days. If you use skinless fish, marinate it for a shorter period of time. You can also use salmon and sea bass in this recipe.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Marinate the Fish (2–3 days before serving)
Sprinkle 2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt over 4 fillets sablefish (gindara) and set it aside for 30 minutes. The salt will draw out excess moisture and reduce the fish‘s odor.
Meanwhile, make the marinade. In a bowl, add 6 Tbsp Saikyo miso (Kyoto-style white miso), 3 Tbsp mirin, and 3 Tbsp sake for the traditional recipe. (Optional: If you are using 6 Tbsp white miso, add 1 Tbsp sugar.) Tip: While in some recipes we can replace sake with water, it‘s not a suitable substitute in this recipe due to the longer marination time required.
Mix it all together and pour the marinade into a flat-bottomed airtight container.
Pour 2 Tbsp sake over the fish to rinse off the salt. Gently pat dry with a paper towel to remove the moisture. Do not wash the fish under running water.
Place the fish in the container and coat both sides with the marinade.
Slather the fillets with the marinade. Cover the container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days for the traditional method. Tip: If you are not using Saikyo miso or regular white miso, you can reduce the marination time to several hours or overnight. Since other miso types are saltier than white miso, please adjust the flavor by adding more mirin or/and sugar.
To Remove the Marinade from the Fish
With your fingers, wipe off the marinade from fish completely. Do not leave any excess marinade on the fish; otherwise, it will burn easily. At this point, you can individually wrap the fish with plastic wrap and store it in a freezer bag for up to 2–3 weeks. Defrost in the refrigerator before cooking.
To Bake (Recommended)
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200ºC) with a rack placed in the center of the oven. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Place the fish skin side up on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Bake the fish until the surface is blistered and browned a bit, about 20 minutes. You do not need to flip the fish. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish.
To Broil (Optional)
Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. Tip: When broiling, you don‘t control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It‘s similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *There are usually three broiler settings: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use the Medium (6 inches away) or High (8 inches away) setting.
Place the fish skin side up on the foil-lined baking sheet and broil on High (550ºF/288ºC) for 8–10 minutes until the surface is blistered and browned a bit. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. You do not need to flip the fish.
To Serve
Carefully transfer the fish with a spatula and remove any burnt miso from the fish. Serve immediately. I serve the fish with thinly sliced red radishes and garnish it with a small green leaf from my backyard for additional color. We always eat this dish with rice.

One batch of this recipe makes two negiyaki pancakes. To make more, you can double or triple the ingredients (tap the 2x or 3x button to scale up), but you can only mix one batch of batter at a time. If you mix more than that, any batter left in the bowl will go flat and your pancake will not be fluffy. Mix only what you can cook right away. For one batch, use two frying pans (or a large griddle) and cook both pancakes at the same time. If you only have one frying pan, mix half a batch and cook one pancake at a time.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Here‘s how to prepare the ingredients for one batch of two pancakes. First, discard the ends of 14 green onions/scallions. Then, thinly slice the green onions crosswise into rounds.
Cut 4 oz sliced pork belly into strips 5 inches (13 cm) long. I used kitchen shears. I also cut off the fatty ends.
Grind ½ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) into a powder using a mortar and pestle. You should have 4 tsp katsuobushi powder; set aside half for the batter and half for cooking the pancakes.
To Mix the Batter (one batch at a time)
Now, I will show you how to mix one batch of batter. First, put the chopped green onions in a large bowl. Then, add ½ cup all-purpose flour (plain flour). Toss with a spoon to coat the green onions in the flour. DO NOT overmix. It‘s OK to leave some flour at the bottom of the bowl. Tip: Mix only one batch of batter at a time, even if you are making two or three batches.
To the bowl, add ½ tsp baking powder, 4 Tbsp tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), 2 tsp katsuobushi powder, 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), ½ tsp soy sauce, and ⅓ cup water.
Mix with a spoon until just combined. DO NOT overmix. Use the spoon to divide the batter in half in the bowl (for two pancakes). Tip: For a light and fluffy negiyaki, cook the batter as soon as you mix it; do not leave any the batter in the bowl.
To Cook the Negiyaki
You will cook two pancakes at once using two pans; I'll show you one pan in my step-by-step images. Heat two large frying pans or a large griddle over medium heat. When hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil to each pan. When the oil is hot, spoon half the batter into each pan. Spread the batter in a round shape about 5–6 inches (13–15 cm) across.
For each pancake, sprinkle 1 tsp katsuobushi powder on top. Then, spread 4 slices of pork belly across the top of each. Cook, uncovered, on medium heat for 2 minutes.
Using two spatulas, flip the pancakes over.
Gently press down on the pancakes and fix the round shape, if needed. Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pans with their lids and cook for 4 minutes.
Open the lids and flip again.
Increase the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, for 1 minute. Transfer to individual plates. The side with the pork belly should be facing up.
To Serve
For a soy sauce flavor, brush the negiyaki with soy sauce and drizzle with a zigzag pattern of Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise (you can make my homemade recipe).
For an okonomi sauce flavor, use a spoon to spread okonomi sauce (you can make my quick homemade version) on the negiyaki and drizzle with a zigzag pattern of Japanese mayonnaise.

Please note that this recipe requires a chill time of at least 1 hour.
Use a spoon to remove the seeds from ½ kabocha squash. Use a razor-sharp knife to cut the kabocha half into 2-inch wedges; I cut mine into 4 wedges. Cut the wedges into roughly 2-inch cubes; it doesn't need to be exact as you'll be mashing it later. Tip: If your kabocha is very hard to cut, you can microwave it for about 30 seconds (1000W) to soften it slightly. For more information, read my post How To Cut a Kabocha Squash.
Next, peel the green skin from the kabocha cubes: Lay each wedge on its flat side and slice or shave off the peel with your knife.
Set a steamer basket in a large pot (I use a Dutch oven). Pour 1 cup water into the bottom of the pot.
Add the peeled kabocha pieces to the steamer basket in a single layer for even cooking. I use all the surface area of the steamer basket, even the curved sides. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and steam for 15 minutes (depending on the size of your kabocha pieces).
Meanwhile, cut ½ red onion into thin slices. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and rub it into the onion until it wilts a bit.
Squeeze out the liquid from the onion slices with your hands and set aside.
Cut 5 slices ham (optional) into thin strips.
After 15 minutes, check if the kabocha is cooked. If a wooden skewer pierces the kabocha easily, it's done. Transfer the kabocha to a bowl or a mortar and pestle.
To Assemble the Salad
Roughly smash the kabocha with the pestle, leaving some chunks for texture.
Season with ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
Add the red onion slices to the bowl and mix well.
Add 2 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and 2 Tbsp cream cheese. I measured the cream cheese spread using a cookie scoop. Mix with the kabocha to combine.
Add the strips of ham (optional) and mix.
Cover the salad with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour. When you're ready to serve, I recommend adding some cream cheese streaks here and there on the top for decoration.

To Cut the Vegetables
Peel and cut 1 onion in half lengthwise, then slice each half into 5–6 wedges. Cut the wedges in half crosswise.
Cut 1 red bell pepper in half lengthwise and remove the stem and seeds.
Cut the halves lengthwise into 1-inch strips, then cut each strip crosswise into three pieces.
Cut off the stem and calyx of 2 Japanese or Chinese eggplants, then cut the eggplant into chunks. I use the rangiri Japanese cutting technique, rotating the eggplant a quarter turn between cuts. This increases the surface area so it cooks evenly and absorbs more flavor.
Peel 1 russet potato and cut it crosswise into 1-inch rounds.
Cut the rounds into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Soak the potato in water to remove the starch and prevent it from changing color.
Crush 3 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press). Chop 5 sprigs parsley and set aside for garnish. Open 1 (14-oz) can whole peeled or crushed tomato and juice; if your tomatoes are whole, cut them into smaller pieces with kitchen shears.
To Prepare the Chicken
Trim off the fat from 1½ lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Then, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to the cutting board), and slice the chicken thigh crosswise into a large piece about 2 x 3 inches (5 x 7.5 cm).
This sogigiri Japanese cutting technique creates pieces of equal thickness with more surface area for faster cooking and better flavor absorption. Continue to slice the rest of the chicken into large pieces. I yielded roughly 4 pieces per large chicken thigh.
Season the chicken pieces on both sides with 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
Next, dredge the chicken in 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour). The flour acts as a shield to seal in the seared chicken's juices; it also thickens the broth later. Here, I put the flour and chicken in my favorite large prep tray.
Put the lid on the tray and shake until the chicken is evenly coated with flour.
To Sear the Chicken
Heat a large frying pan (I use a carbon steel pan for better browning and easier to flip) over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Add several chicken pieces to the hot oil and sear on one side until a beautiful crust forms, about 2 minutes. Cook in batches and do not crowd the pan to avoid steaming the chicken.
Flip over to sear the other side, then transfer to a tray or plate.
Continue to sear the rest of the chicken and transfer it to the tray. Lower the heat to medium heat.
To the same pan, add about 1 Tbsp of the oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions.
Stir with a wooden spatula and cook the onions until golden brown. If the onions are burning, reduce the heat to medium-low.
Add 3 Tbsp sake and use the spatula to scrape off the caramelized brown bits (fond) on the bottom of the pan from cooking the chicken.
To Cook the Stew
Once you've deglazed the pan, transfer the onions and pan juices to a large heavy-bottomed pot like a Dutch oven. Add the seared chicken to the pot.
Add the red bell pepper, eggplant, and tomatoes with juice.
Add 1 cup water to the can to collect any remaining tomato juice and pour the liquid into the pot. Add the crushed garlic.
Use the spatula to press down on the ingredients as much as you can. Cover with a lid and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. It will seem like a lot of vegetables at first, but they will sweat and release moisture as they cook. Eventually, they will shrink and create enough liquid to cover the ingredients.
Once simmering, tuck the vegetables into the cooking liquid once again. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover to simmer for 45 minutes.
To Add the Miso and Potatoes
After 45 minutes, open the lid and give the stew a gentle stir. Next, completely dissolve 3 Tbsp miso in a ladleful of hot broth before releasing it to the stew. I use a miso muddler and large Japanese draining ladle, or you could use chopsticks and a standard ladle.
Drain the potatoes. Add them to the stew, cover the pot, and gently simmer for 15–20 minutes.
Check if the potatoes are cooked by inserting a wooden skewer; if it easily pierces a potato, it's done. Finally, taste the stew and adjust the seasoning. You can add a tiny bit of miso or salt here to bring out more flavor, if you'd like; I usually don't need to add more.
To Serve
Serve hot in individual bowls and garnish with chopped parsley. I like to serve it with steamed rice or a slice of crusty bread. Enjoy!

To Prepare the Ingredients
Peel 2 carrots with a vegetable peeler. Then, cut the carrots into thin, long strips with a julienne peeler. You can also julienne with your knife using the hosogiri cutting technique.
Save any leftover pieces of carrot that you can't peel to use in another dish later. Place the julienned carrots in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a damp paper towel.
Cook the carrots in the microwave for 1 minute (1000W) to lightly soften them. Remove the paper towel and let cool.
Thinly slice ½ red onion. Soak the sliced onion in a bowl of cold water to remove the bitterness.
To Make the Dressing
Meanwhile, make the dressing. To a large mixing bowl, add 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 2 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1 tsp soy sauce, ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper, and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.
Combine with a whisk. Cut the lemon in half (reserve the extra lemon for garnish). Squeeze 2 tsp lemon juice into the dressing and whisk again.
To Toss the Salad
Drain 1 can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil) and add the tuna to the bowl. Break it into small pieces and coat with the dressing.
Then, add the cooled carrots and toss with the tuna.
Squeeze the water from the onion slices and add them to the bowl.
Add most of the ½ Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds to the bowl (reserving some for garnish) and give everything another toss.
Cover the bowl and marinate the salad in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Transfer the Carrot and Tuna Salad to a serving plate.
To Serve
Garnish with the remaining sesame seeds, optional lemon wedge, and optional parsley sprigs. Enjoy!

I use an electric pot for this recipe and others in the 10-Minute Meal series. You also could use a regular saucepan on the stove.
To Mix the Sauce
In a bowl, combine the sauce ingredients: 1 Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste), ½ Tbsp oyster sauce, ½ Tbsp miso, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, ½ tsp toasted sesame oil, ½ tsp potato starch or cornstarch, and 2 Tbsp water. Stir with a whisk until smooth.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Thinly slice 1 green onion/scallion. Set aside a bit for garnish.
Cut ¼ block soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu) into small cubes.
Peel and mince 1 inch ginger. Mince 1 clove garlic (I use a garlic press).
To Cook
Turn on the heat to medium-high on the stove or Mode II (600W) on the electric pot. When it's hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Add the ginger and garlic to the hot oil and sauté until fragrant; do not let it burn.
Add 4 oz ground pork and break up the chunks of meat with a spatula. Cook until the meat is no longer pink.
Give the sauce mixture a final stir, then add it to the pot. Simmer and stir to combine with the meat and thicken the sauce.
Once the sauce is bubbling, lower the heat to medium or Mode I (250W). Carefully add the cubes of tofu to the pot.
Coat the tofu with the sauce by shaking the pot as you stir gently. This will minimize breaking the tofu. Now, add most of the green onions, setting aside some for garnish.
Cover with a lid and let it simmer for a minute. Do not overcook as the tofu's texture will change.
Turn off the heat and transfer to individual bowls. Here, I serve it donburi-style over hot steamed rice.

To Make the Dressing
Combine 1 Tbsp neutral oil, 3 Tbsp toasted sesame oil, and ½ tsp crushed red pepper (red pepper flakes) in a small saucepan.
Whisk it all together and infuse the oil over medium heat for 3 minutes. The oil should sizzle, but do not burn the chili flakes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1–2 minutes. Tip: If you smell something burnt, the heat is too strong or you cooked it too long.
Add 3 Tbsp honey and whisk well until it has completely dissolved. Tip: Don‘t add the soy sauce first as it will splatter in the hot oil.
Add 3 Tbsp soy sauce to the mixture and whisk it all together. Set aside.
To Make the Salad
Add 7 oz dried soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are al dente. Tip: I like to boil the noodles for 30 seconds less than the package instructions. Mine says to cook for 4 minutes, so I cook for 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
Meanwhile, thinly slice 2 green onions/scallions.
Discard the stems of 1 handful cilantro (coriander) and chop the leafy parts into small pieces.
Drain the soba noodles into a colander and rinse them with your hand under cold running water. This important step removes the excess starch and stops the cooking.
Drain well and transfer to a large bowl. Pour the cooled dressing over the noodles.
Add the green onions, cilantro leaves, and 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds to the noodles. Toss everything together.

Use a knife to cut ½ onion into thin slices.
Peel ½ carrot (I love using my Japanese peeler). Then, cut it in a rangiri shape by rotating the carrot a quarter turn between diagonal cuts. The rangiri Japanese cutting technique creates an attractive shape with more surface area to absorb the seasonings.

To Make the Filling
Mince the onion finely. Lay ¾ onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, make ⅛-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. Then, with the knife edge toward the root end, make ⅛-inch horizontal slices, again keeping the root intact.
Finally, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made. To mince the onion pieces finer, run your knife through them using a rocking motion while holding down the tip of the knife.
Put the finely minced onion in a large bowl and add 2½ Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch. Mix together.
With a knife, scrape off the skin of the ginger and grate it. You will need 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice).
In a medium bowl, combine 14 oz ground pork, the grated ginger with juice, 1 Tbsp sake, and ½ Tbsp toasted sesame oil.
Add 2 tsp sugar and 1 Tbsp soy sauce.
And ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp white pepper powder.
Using your hands (or with plastic food gloves), knead the meat mixture until it‘s pale, sticky, and pasty.
Then, transfer the meat to the bowl with the onion.
Mix the onion and meat together until well combined.
To Wrap the Shumai
Prepare 35 wonton wrappers, a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, a 1 Tbsp measuring spoon, and a butter knife. Make sure the wonton wrappers are covered in plastic wrap or a damp towel while you stuff the filling so they don‘t dry out.
Scoop the filling into the measuring spoon and level the meat off with the knife. Transfer the filling to the center of a wonton wrapper.
Using your left hand (if you’re a righty), make a round hole by connecting your thumb and index finger with the rest of fingers next to each other. Place a wonton wrapper with the filling on top of it. Tip: Once you get used to making shumai, you can place the wrapper and then directly put the filling on top, instead of using a measuring spoon.
Using the butter knife or the back of a teaspoon, gently press the filling down while holding the fingers firmly. After you press the meat down, rotate the shumai 45 degrees so the meat is evenly distributed in the center of the wrapper. Finally, smooth out the surface of the meat.
Your left fingers should look like this while you press the meat inside, the ring finger and pinky right underneath the bottom of the shumai to create the flat base. Continue with the rest of the wrappers and filling until one of them runs out.
To Steam the Shumai
When you finish wrapping, bring 1–2 cups of water in a wok (or steamer) to boil over high heat (or medium-high heat if you’re using nonstick). Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bamboo steamer basket. Meanwhile, with 3 Tbsp green peas, place a pea in the center of each shumai. Tip: If you don’t have a steamer, read my blog post above on how to steam shumai without a steamer.
Prepare a piece of parchment paper (make a few air vent holes) or cabbage leaves and place them on the bottom of the steamer basket to prevent the shumai from sticking. Put the dumplings on top without touching each other. Most likely, you will need to steam them in batches. When the water is boiling, place the bamboo steamer basket onto the wok and steam for 8–10 minutes until the meat is cooked through.
After 8–10 minutes, check to see if the meat is cooked through. Then transfer the bamboo steamer basket on top of a large plate.
To Serve
Bring to the table and serve immediately. Make a dipping sauce in individual sauce plates with soy sauce, rice vinegar (unseasoned), la-yu (Japanese chili oil) and Japanese karashi hot mustard.
To Store
You can freeze the dumplings before or after steaming them. Place each shumai on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper without touching each other, and flash freeze for 1 hour. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag. You can steam frozen shumai without thawing (just steam for an extra few minutes).",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,

From 1 lb boneless, skin-on chicken thighs, cut each chicken thigh into 2 pieces (as you see, this chicken thigh is large). Cut off any excess fat. Prick the skin with the tip of the knife to help distribute the flavors and heat faster.
Lightly sprinkle both sides with ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl: 2½ Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp mirin, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
To Cook the Chicken
Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. When it‘s hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and distribute it evenly. Add the chicken, skin side down, to the hot pan. (If you‘re doubling the recipe, fry the chicken in batches and return it to the pan before continuing to the next section.)
Cook the chicken until golden brown, roughly 4–5 minutes.
When the bottom side is nicely brown and crisp, flip over and cook the other side for 3 minutes.
To Steam and Add the Sauce
Add 4 Tbsp sake and cook, covered, until cooking liquid is gone.
Remove the lid and wipe off any excess oil from the frying pan with a paper towel.
Add the sauce ingredients and 1 Tbsp unsalted butter.
Coat the chicken well with the sauce. Spoon it over the chicken a few times.

Gather the tuna salad ingredients. Then, mince ⅛ onion and soak the pieces in water for 5 minutes to remove the bitterness and astringency.
Squeeze the water out and add to a bowl along with ½ (5-ounce) can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil), well drained.
Add 2 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise, Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Mix with a fork. Flake the tuna chunks into smaller pieces and incorporate the seasonings well. Set aside. You can cover it and store in the refrigerator while you make the egg salad.
To Make the Egg Salad
Gather the egg salad ingredients. This recipe makes enough filling for two Tamago Sando. You can store the leftover egg salad in an airtight container for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. Put 3 large large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover by one inch (2.5 cm). Bring it to a boil on medium heat. Once boiling, cook for 12 minutes.
Once it’s finished cooking, transfer the eggs to iced water to stop the cooking. Let them cool completely and peel the eggshells.
Transfer the peeled eggs to a bowl and mash with a fork. Try to mash the egg whites into small, same-sized pieces.
Add ¼ tsp sugar and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.
Add ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper and 2 tsp milk. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.
Add 2 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and mix very well.
To Assemble the Sandwiches
Gather the filling ingredients for the three types of sandwiches.
If your bread is not pre-sliced, cut the shokupan (Japanese milk bread) into 6 thin slices, each about ⅓ to ½ inch (1 to 1.2 cm) thick. Lay out the 6 bread slices for the 3 sandwiches.
Using a butter knife, spread a thin layer of salted butter on all 6 slices. For the Tamago Sando, scoop the egg salad onto 1 of the slices and spread to distribute evenly.
For the Ham and Cheese Sando, spread Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise (and mustard, if desired) onto 2 of the buttered slices. On 1 of those slices, layer 2 leaves iceberg lettuce, 2 slices ham, 2 slices Swiss cheese, and 6 slices Japanese or Persian cucumber on top.
For the Tuna Sando, scoop the tuna salad onto 1 of the remaining sandwich slices and spread evenly. Put the other slice of bread on top, buttered side down. For the Ham and Cheese Sando, put the slice on top that has both the butter and mayonnaise, spread side down. Finally, put the remaining slice of bread on top of the egg salad, buttered side down. Then, place plates on top of the sandwiches to compress the ingredients slightly. Set aside for 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes, remove the plates. If you‘d like, cut the crusts off the sandwiches. Tip: Don't throw away the crusts and repurpose them to make Shokupan Crust Rusks. These crunchy, buttery snacks are so delicious! You can make them now or freeze those crust strips and make them later.
Cut each sandwich horizontally into thirds for three equal rectangular pieces. They‘re now ready to serve. For each serving, arrange one piece of each type of sandwich onto a plate for a total of three pieces. In the photo to the right, I show how to present two servings in a carry-out box.

Shiratama Dango,"['7 oz shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) (1 bag, 200 g per bag; roughly 1⅓–1⅔ cups; you can buy it on Amazon; if you can‘t find it, use mochiko) 1 1⅓–1⅔ ', '¾ cup water (divided, roughly 80%/20%; you may not need all of it; if you use mochiko, use less water)']","[{""ingredient"": ""shiratamako"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""water"", ""heat_processed"": true}]","Gather all the ingredients. Note: Shiratama Dango are traditionally made without sugar since we always eat them with something sweet. If you want to make them sweeter, you can add up to ¼ cup (50 g) sugar, adjusting to your preference. If you add sugar, you must use less water. Mix the sugar into the shiratamako first, then gradually add water as instructed.
Start boiling water in a medium pot. Once it boils, turn down the heat and cover with a lid until you‘re ready to cook the dumplings.
To Make the Dough
Add 7 oz shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) to a large bowl. Gradually add 80% of the water while mixing well with chopsticks or a silicone spatula. Set aside the remaining water for the next step, in case you need it. You might not need to add the entire ¾ cup water. Tip: If you have accidentally added all the water at once, quickly place a paper towel over it and absorb excess water before mixing. If you already mixed it in, you‘ll have to add more shiratamako.
Once the flour and water form small clumps, start mixing by hand. Use the mass of dough to pick up the flour pieces in the bowl. The dough will be quite dry. Knead until it becomes a firm, smooth ball; in Japanese, we call this an “earlobe-like“ texture. It‘s the perfect consistency if you can cleanly break apart the dough mass in half. If it is too crumbly to form a ball, add a bit more water onto your hand, knead it into the dough, and check again. Tip: If it feels soft like children‘s play dough, you‘ve added too much water. In that case, knead in a bit of shiratamako and check for the correct dough consistency.
To Cut and Shape the Dough
Roll the dough into a smooth ball, then cut it into 4 equal pieces with a knife or dough scraper. Roll out each piece into a log.
Cut each log into small pieces. You should have about 30 pieces total.
Roll each small piece into a ¾-inch (2-cm) ball.
With your finger, make an indentation in the center of each ball ¼ inch (6 mm) deep. This will help the dumplings cook faster and have a less doughy texture after cooking.
To Cook the Shiratama Dango
To the pot of boiling water, add the Shiratama Dango. You may need to cook in batches.
Once they float to the surface, cook for an additional 1 minute.
Remove them from the pot and soak in ice water to let them cool. Once cooled, transfer to a plate or tray. Your Shiratama Dango are now ready to serve in your favorite dessert or snack.
To Serve
Enjoy Shiratama Dango drizzled with kuromitsu (black sugar syrup) or dusted with kinako (roasted soybean flour) mixed with sugar. Add these dumplings to hot dessert soups like Oshiruko/Zenzai or Matcha Zensai. Use them as a topping for Ujikintoki (Matcha Shaved Ice) and kanten jelly with fruits (Anmitsu). You can even get creative and try them in Western-style desserts like Matcha Vegan Panna Cotta.

Gather all the ingredients. It’s very important to let the milk and eggs come to room temperature. If you’re in a hurry, you can microwave the milk to room temperature and place the cold eggs in lukewarm water. I share a lot of tips and techniques in my blog post, and I encourage you to read them before you start making the crepes.
I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. For weights, click the Metric button above. If you‘re using a cup measure, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
To Make the Crepe Batter
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup cake flour, 1 Tbsp sugar, and ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and whisk to combine. Set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, beat 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) with the whisk until smooth.
Add about one-third of the 1½ cups milk to the eggs and beat well. Add the remaining milk in two parts, whisking it all together.
Add one-third of the egg/milk mixture into the flour and gently whisk to form a smooth paste.
Add half of the remaining mixture and whisk until completely incorporated.
Add the rest of the mixture and whisk to combine until it becomes a smooth batter. Optional: If you’re making the crepe batter ahead of time, you can cover and refrigerate it at this point.
Add 3 Tbsp unsalted butter (melted) to the mixture and whisk to combine. Do not overmix the batter. Important: The batter must be at room temperature. If the batter is cold, the fat in the butter will solidify and make the batter grainy.
To Cook the Crepes
Heat a 10-inch (25-cm) crepe pan (or regular pan) over medium heat. When it’s warm, lightly grease the pan with some of the 1 Tbsp neutral oil using a silicone brush or paper towel. Make sure you don‘t see any oil streaks left on the pan. If you do, wipe off the excess oil with a paper towel. Tip: Splash a small amount of water into the pan to see if it makes a sizzling sound. If the water dances around, the pan is hot and ready!
Pour ⅓ cup batter into the center of the pan and swirl it around the pan to evenly coat the surface. Tilt the pan steeply so that most of the batter spreads from the center to the rim.
Then, rotate the pan to spread the batter around and distribute it evenly. If you see any small holes, shake the pan vigorously side to side to fill up the holes while the mixture is still runny.
Cook the crepe until the batter looks dry on top and the edges begin to brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Slide a long cooking chopstick (or a long, skinny metal spatula or an offset spatula) under all sides of the crepe, loosening it from the bottom of the pan. If you have a nonstick pan, your crepe may slide around.
After you slide the chopstick under the crepe, raise it up in the middle and flip it over. You can use your fingertips to flip it, but I use the chopstick and turn my wrist to flip the crepe (see the video).
Cook the other side for 15–20 seconds until golden brown.
Slide the chopstick under the crepe again, raise it up in the middle, and transfer it to a plate, with the bottom side (the pretty side) facing down.
Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat if the crepes are cooking or browning too fast. Important: Remove any crumbs in the pan and lightly grease the pan before you start another crepe. If the crepe gets stuck and burnt on the same spot, wash the pan and start over again.
To Serve
Use the crepe as desired (see below for some ideas) and serve immediately. To make fresh whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream and 2 Tbsp sugar on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3–4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping and piping on desserts. Use immediately or cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.
To Make a Lemon Sugar Crepe: Sprinkle confectioners’ sugar on a crepe and squeeze some juice from a lemon on top.
Fold the crepe into quarters, garnish with lemon slices, and sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar.
To Make a Nutella Banana Crepe: Spread a crepe with Nutella and put some banana slices on top.
Fold the crepe into quarters, drizzle with chocolate syrup, and sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar.
To Make a Japanese-Style Crepe: Put some freshly whipped cream on a quarter of a crepe and place some sliced strawberries and banana on top of the whipped cream.

I usually pat dry the chicken with paper towels for my oven-broiled Salted Chicken Wing recipe to remove any excess moisture, but we can skip this process (and save paper towels) when using a smoker. The air ventilates really well inside the smoker and the skin gets super crispy every time.
Here, I‘ll show you how to season the wings with both flavor options. Generously sprinkle 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt on the skin side of all the wing pieces (I use a sifter). For the salt and pepper wings, sprinkle ¾ tsp freshly ground black pepper on a HALF PORTION of the chicken wings. I will season the other half of the wings with the spicy soy glaze, so there‘s no need to add black pepper here.
Flip the wings and repeat the previous step.
Preheat your smoker (I use a Traeger grill) to 450ºF (232ºC) using your favorite pellets.
Place the wings directly on the grill grates, close the lid, and smoke for 20–25 minutes, depending on their size. You can start preparing the spicy soy glaze during this time.
At the 20- to 25-minute mark, rotate or flip the wings to maintain even cooking and avoid any hot spots on the grill. Cook the other side for 20–25 minutes. Use an instant-read thermometer to make sure chicken is cooked to a safe internal temperature of 165ºF (74ºC). Cooking time may vary slightly depending on the size of the wings.
To Make the Spicy Soy Glaze
Meanwhile, separate the white and green parts of 1 green onion. Diagonally slice the green part of the green onion for garnish and set aside. Cut the white part in half to fit into a small pot.
Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure ½ tsp ginger, grated, with juice.
Gather all the spicy soy glaze ingredients.
In a small pot, combine the glaze ingredients: the white part of the green onion, the grated ginger, ¼ cup mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, ¼ cup soy sauce, 1 Tbsp sugar, ¼ tsp crushed red pepper (red pepper flakes), and 1 clove garlic (minced or pressed; I use a garlic press).
Simmer the sauce on low heat for 10–15 minutes until the liquid is reduced by half.
Turn off the heat. Remove and discard the green onion. Set the glaze aside until the wings are done cooking.
To Serve
Remove the wings from the grill. Make sure to separate the salt and pepper wings from the spicy soy glaze wings.
Add the wings for the spicy soy glaze version to a large bowl and pour the sauce on top. Toss the wings in the sauce to coat well.
Arrange the spicy soy glaze wings on a serving dish and garnish with the sliced green onions. For the salt and pepper wings, arrange on a serving dish with a wedge of lemon on the side.

Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
To Prepare the Corn
Slice off the corn kernels from 4 ears sweet corn.
Place the corn kernels on a rimmed baking sheet, saving the cobs for later.
Add 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, a sprinkle of kosher salt, and ¼ tsp paprika.
Mix all together with your hands and spread it out evenly in a single layer. Roast the corn kernels in the middle rack position at 450ºF (230ºC) degrees for 15 minutes. Once it‘s done, remove it from the oven and set it aside.
To Prepare the Soup
Meanwhile, thinly slice ½ onion against the grain. Heat 1½ Tbsp unsalted butter in a heavy-bottomed pot.
Add the sliced onion and a pinch of kosher salt. Sauté until translucent.
Add the roasted kernels and 3 cups water.
Add the reserved cobs to the pot to naturally sweeten the soup. Push the cobs down to check if they are completely covered by the liquid; if not, add more water until submerged.
Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and lower the heat to medium-low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. During this time, skim the foam on the surface for a more refined taste. After 15 minutes, discard the cobs.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy and smooth. If you use a food processor or blender, let the soup cool for a few minutes before blending to avoid major splashes and cover the opening with a towel.
If you want to make your soup similar to corn potage (Japanese corn soup), strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve for a smoother consistency.
Transfer the soup back to the pot. Add 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream and 1 cup milk. The ratio is entirely up to you. Here, I used equal parts milk and heavy cream, 1 cup each.

To Make the Ginger Soy Sauce
Peel the ginger and grate it (I love using my ceramic grater) and measure ½ tsp ginger grated, with juice.
In a large bowl, combine 2 Tbsp soy sauce and the grated ginger. Taste it and add more grated ginger or ginger juice (which has a milder taste than the ginger bits) if desired. Set aside.
To Prepare the Okra
With a knife, cut off the stems of 9 oz okra but don‘t remove the entire top. Then, peel off the tough calyx around the top of the okra.

Since the unagi sauce can keep for 3 months, I recommend making double or triple the amount for future unagi recipes or Yaki Onigiri.
To Make the Unagi Sauce
To a small saucepan, add ¼ cup mirin, 1½ Tbsp sake, and 2½ Tbsp sugar.
Set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and whisk the mixture together. Then, add ¼ cup soy sauce and bring the mixture to a boil.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer; you should see small bubbles around the edge of the pan. Continue simmering until the liquid is reduced to roughly one-third of the original amount, about 10-15 minutes. Tip: To check how much the sauce has reduced, dip the tip of a wooden chopstick into the liquid to mark the original amount; then, insert the chopstick again later to compare the sauce level against the original mark.
Toward the end of cooking, the sauce will thicken and you will see more bubbles. Use the chopstick to confirm that the thickened sauce is one-third of the original amount. Then, remove it from the heat. As it cools, the sauce will thicken more. Tip: If you feel you've reduced it too much, add a bit of water to loosen up the sauce; you also can simmer it again a bit more to get the right consistency.
To Cut the Unagi
Cut 2 unagi (freshwater eel) fillets in half or thirds to fit the size of your donburi serving bowl.
To Broil (recommended)
Preheat the broiler* on High (550ºF/288ºC) for 5 minutes with a rack placed about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven). *The broiler settings are Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually broil on High (8 inches away) or Medium (6 inches away). When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill.
Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleaning and brush or spray the oil onto the foil. Place the unagi pieces on the foil, skin side down. Broil the unagi until the surface is blistered a bit, about 5-7 minutes. Broil it on one side only; there's no need to flip it over.
Open the oven and brush the sauce on top of the unagi. Then, broil again for 30-60 seconds until you see the sauce bubbling on top.
To Bake
Preheat the oven to 425°F/218ºC with a rack placed in the middle position. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and place the unagi pieces on top. Bake until the surface is blistered a bit, about 10-12 minutes. Bake on one side only; no need to flip. Brush the sauce on top of the unagi. Then, bake again for 30-60 seconds until you see the sauce bubbling on top.
To Heat in a Pan
Prepare two 16 inch x 16 inch (40 x 40 cm) sheets of aluminum foil. Thinly spread some cooking spray in the center of each sheet. Place two pieces of unagi on a sheet of greased foil. Bring the top and bottom foil edges together above the unagi. Fold and press the edges together a few times. Then, tightly close either side of the foil to form a sack. Repeat this process for the other unagi pieces. Add the foil pouches to the pan and reheat on low heat for 5-8 minutes. Tip: Your unagi won't blister or char if you use this method.
To Serve
Serve the hot steamed rice in individual bowls. Then, pour or brush some of the unagi sauce on top of the rice.
Next, place one portion of the unagi on the rice in each bowl. Pour or brush more sauce on top of the unagi. Since I had a kinome (Japanese sansho pepper leaf), I placed it on top for garnish (optional). Serve immediately. You can also sprinkle ground Japanese sansho pepper on top (optional).
To serve in a jubako (Japanese lacquered box), place a bed of hot rice in the box and brush some unagi sauce on top. For each serving, place 2 pieces of unagi (the entire fillet) on top, with the pieces overlapping each other and covering the rice. Brush more sauce on top of the unagi pieces and serve.

Soak 2 lb bone-in beef short ribs in cold water for 30 minutes to get rid of the blood, changing the water a few times. Pat the meat dry with paper towels. Place the ribs in a shallow tray.
In a medium bowl, whisk all the marinade ingredients together: ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup mirin, 3 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste), 4 cloves garlic (minced or pressed), 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil, ½ Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds, and 1 green onion/scallion (chopped).
Pour the marinade over the ribs, turning them to coat completely in the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight, turning the ribs a few times while marinating.
Prepare charcoal or preheat a gas grill to 450°F (230°C). Clean and lightly oil the grill grate. For the best flavor, I recommend using charcoal instead of a gas grill. When you add charcoal to the grill, pile the charcoal to one side. We will use both indirect and direct heat to cook the short ribs.
Remove the short ribs from the marinade and let any excess drip off; discard the marinade. Grill the short ribs directly over the charcoal until nicely seared, then flip once to sear the other side. After searing both sides, move the short ribs to the side of the grill surface not directly over the charcoal. Continue grilling for about 5–6 minutes total. Transfer to a serving platter.

Now, gather all the ingredients.
In a small saucepan, add 2½ cups strong-brewed coffee. (To use instant coffee powder or crystals, add 2½ cups water now, but wait until Step 4 to add the instant powder). Then, add 1 stick packet kanten (agar) powder.
Whisk well and bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes, continuously whisking the mixture. Tip: Kanten powder is hard to see, but be sure to dissolve it completely at this stage. If you don‘t, the mixture will not solidify. Learn more about kanten in the end Notes.
Turn off the heat. Add ⅓ cup sugar (and 2 Tbsp instant coffee powder, if using). Whisk until the sugar has dissolved.
Run a square or rectangular mold (I used a nagashikan that is 15 x 14 cm or about 6 x 5½ inches) under running tap water so the jelly doesn‘t stick. Shake off the excess water, but do not wipe it dry. Pour the hot mixture into the mold. Tip: If you don‘t have a nagashikan, you could use a baking pan or dish that is 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20 cm). It will create a flatter, single layer of jelly. Another serving option: To serve the jelly (without cutting) in individual glassware, let the hot mixture cool for 5 minutes, then pour it into the glass serving dishes.
Remove the bubbles on the surface by quickly touching them with the flame from a butane torch (also called a kitchen torch) or a long-stemmed utility/candle lighter. You also could scoop them off with a spoon or pop them with a toothpick, but those are both time-consuming methods. Once the bubbles disappear, let the mixture cool to room temperature on the countertop and solidify (about 45–60 minutes). The jelly will set before it reaches room temperature.
Once the coffee jelly cools down, cover it with a paper towel and plastic (or a silicone lid) and refrigerate for 4–5 hours. Tip: The paper towel absorbs condensation.
To Make the Topping
Coffee jelly tastes great with a sweetened condensed milk topping. To make it, combine 3 Tbsp sweetened condensed milk and 3 Tbsp milk and mix well. Adjust the consistency and sweetness based on your preference. Add more sweetened condensed milk for a sweeter, thicker mixture.
To Serve
Take out the nagashikan or pan from the refrigerator. Run a knife along the edges of the jelly. Then, lift the inner tray from the nagashikan.
Slide the jelly from the inner tray (or invert the pan to release the jelly) onto a cutting board. Cut into ½-inch (1.3-cm) cubes.
Transfer the cubed jelly to individual serving dishes. If you poured and chilled the jelly in individual glass dishes, take them out of the refrigerator now. Serve with the toppings of your choice. I like to add whipped cream, mint, and a coffee bean on top. Drizzle with the sweetened condensed milk topping. Enjoy!

Before You Start: You must use Japanese short-grain rice or your sushi will fall apart. Please note that ¾ measuring cup of uncooked Japanese rice is 1 rice cooker cup (150 g, 5.3 oz) and yields roughly 2¼ cups (330 g, 11.6 oz) of cooked rice. One sushi roll requires 1 US cup (150 g) of sushi rice.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Make the Sushi Rice
Rinse 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice until the water is almost clear (you can learn how to properly rinse the rice in my post on How to Make Sushi Rice). Put the well-drained rice in the rice cooker inner pot and add 2¼ cups water to just under the 3-cup line for White Rice. If your rice cooker has a Sushi Rice mode, add water up to that line. Place 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) on top of the rice (optional) and let the rice soak in the water for 20–30 minutes. Then, start cooking. If you don‘t have a rice cooker, cook the rice in a pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe with the amount of water I specified in this recipe. Tip: Since we‘ll be adding sushi vinegar to the steamed rice, cook the rice a little bit on the firm side. To achieve this, use a rice-to-water ratio of 1 to 1 for sushi rice (instead of 1 to 1.1 or 1 to 1.2 for regular steamed rice). While the rice is cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients.
When the rice is cooked, discard the used kombu (or repurpose it to make simmered kombu). If using a wooden sushi oke (also called hangiri), moisten it by running water over it and drain well. You can also use a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Transfer the cooked rice to the sushi oke and spread out the rice evenly so it will cool faster.
While it’s hot, pour ⅓ cup seasoned rice vinegar (sushi vinegar) over the rice. With a rice paddle, gently “slice“ the rice at a 45-degree angle to incorporate the sushi vinegar mixture and separate the chunks of rice. Do not stir or mix the rice because the grains may break and the rice will become mushy. While using this slicing motion, vigorously fan the rice with a paddle fan or another type of fan. This cools the rice and takes away the excess moisture. Fanning makes the rice shine and keeps it from becoming mushy. Then, gently flip the rice in between slices. Repeat this process until the rice is cooled to the temperature of human skin. Keep the sushi rice covered with a damp towel (or paper towel) for a few hours at room temperature. To keep it for a longer time, see the To Store section below.
To Make the Pickled Red Onion
Thinly slice ½ red onion and transfer it to a glass jar (or bowl). Add ½ cup seasoned rice vinegar (sushi vinegar) or until they are just covered. Set aside until you prepare the other ingredients.
To Make the Spicy Mayo
In a small bowl, combine ¼ cup Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp sriracha sauce, and splash lime juice and mix it all together. Set it aside.
To Prepare the Other Filling Ingredients
Cut 2 Japanese or Persian cucumbers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds with a spoon. Then, slice each half into 4 long strips. Tip: Seeds contain moisture; therefore, we discard them to avoid excess moisture inside the sushi rolls.
Using a julienne peeler, peel 1 carrot to make julienned strips. If you have a regular vegetable peeler, peel thinly, then cut the sheets into long, thin julienned strips.
Cut 1 deep-fried firm tofu cutlet (atsuage) into slabs. Then, cut the slabs into long sticks.
When everything else is ready, cut 2 avocados in half lengthwise around the seed. Twist the two halves until they separate. Now, if you‘re new to removing the avocado pit, at this point, slice the avocado in quarters lengthwise, then twist it off the seed. If you have removed the pit before, follow my step below.
I usually use my knife, but you must be very careful not to cut your hand if you use this method. First, hold the avocado half in your palm, preferably with a folded kitchen towel to protect your hand. Next, carefully and very gently tap the heel of your knife into the pit with just enough pressure that the knife embeds in it. Then, hold the avocado firmly as you twist the knife and the pit in a counter direction. The pit will come out smoothly. Alternatively, you can slice the avocado in quarters lengthwise, then twist it off the seed.
Cut the avocado halves in half (so now you have avocado quarters) and remove their skin.
Cut each quarter in half lengthwise. Sprinkle splash lime juice from the leftover lime over the cut avocado pieces to prevent them from changing colors.
To Roll
Prepare one of 6 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) with the sushi rice: First, place the nori sheet, shiny side down and long side vertically, on top of the bamboo sushi rolling mat. Next, put 1 cup (150 g) of sushi rice on the nori sheet. Gently and evenly spread the rice with a rice paddle or your fingers, leaving about a ½ inch (1.5 cm) strip of nori along the top edge farthest away from you. If you‘re using fingers, wet them with water occasionally so the rice doesn‘t stick. Tip: You don’t spread the rice to the top edge because after you roll, the sushi rice could come out from the seam and it won’t look pretty. Be sure to spread the rice in an even layer; otherwise, your sushi roll will look uneven.
Next, add your filling ingredients. First, spread a thin strip of spicy mayo in a straight line across the width of the nori sheet about 1½ inches or so from the bottom edge. Next, line up 2–3 cucumber strips on top of the mayo, followed by 3 avocado slices and 2–3 tofu sticks. For a balanced roll, make sure the ingredients are evenly spread out across the width of the nori sheet. Tip: If you are a beginner at sushi rolling, place the filling ingredients at about the one-third line from the bottom edge; in other words, move up the filling slightly toward the middle line compared to mine. It will be easier to lift and roll over the filling if there‘s no filling on the bottom quarter of the nori sheet. Also, place the loose ingredients away from the bottom edge—on the side of the filling that‘s closer to the middle—so they don‘t fall down or move when you roll.
Put some pickled red onion on the avocado slices (the vinegar will help prevent discoloration of the avocado). Then, place several julienned carrot strips evenly next to the avocado slices. Tip: Be careful not to overfill your sushi roll. These ingredients are just an example of what you can put into your roll. If you decide not to add an ingredient, you can replace it with a different filling or skip it all together, in which case you‘ll end up with a thinner role.
Now, take a breath and roll your sushi. Lift the bottom edge of the sushi rolling mat with your thumb and forefinger of both hands. Press your other fingers down on the filling to hold the ingredients in place. Then, roll the nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly until the bottom edge of nori reaches the rice on the other side of the filling (left image).
Firmly hold the rolled portion of the bamboo mat in place with one hand. With your other hand, pick up the other end of the bamboo mat at the top edge. Now, pull the two sides against each other to tighten the roll. Release the top edge of the rolling mat and finish rolling.
Place the bamboo mat over the rolled sushi and tightly squeeze. Cover the finished sushi roll with plastic wrap so it doesn‘t dry out. Continue rolling the rest of the sushi rolls. Keep them in a cool place under plastic wrap (NOT in the refrigerator) until you are ready to serve.
To Serve
Using a very sharp knife, first cut the sushi roll in half. For every slice or every other slice, wipe the knife with a wet kitchen cloth so that you can cut your sushi roll cleanly.
Then, cut each half roll in half again. Cut the quarters in half once more so you have 8 pieces per roll.

To Prepare the Ingredients
With a knife, cut off the stems of 2 okra but don‘t remove the entire top. Then, peel off the tough calyx around the top.
Blanch the okra in a pot of boiling water for 2–3 minutes (or small okra for 1–2 minutes and large okra for 3–4 minutes). As soon as they are tender, drain in a sieve. Do not overcook. Slice crosswise into small pieces.
Peel the skin of 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber in a striped pattern. Slice diagonally into thin oval slabs, then stack and julienne into matchsticks.
Stack and tightly roll up 5 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba), then chiffonade crosswise into thin strips.
Make a Japanese-style poached egg (onsen tamago) in the microwave. (For detailed instructions and step-by-step photos, see my 2-Minute Microwave Onsen Tamago recipe.) Crack 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) into a small, microwave-safe bowl. Pour in some water around the edges to push the egg to the center, then add just enough water on top to submerge the yolk. Puncture the yolk with a toothpick. Place in the microwave at the outer edge of the tray and heat at half power for 90 seconds or until the egg white just solidifies and turns white. Remove it from the water and transfer to a bowl.
Discard the pit of 1 umeboshi (Japanese pickled plums), then chop the flesh.
Open 1 package natto (fermented soybean) and add the sauce packet, umeboshi and shiso. Using chopsticks, mix it together really well. Tip: In Japan, they say to stir the natto 100 times. This incorporates air for a fluffy texture and releases the glutamate in the culture for improved umami.
To Assemble the Cold Natto Udon
Bring water to a boil in a medium pot. Add 1 serving udon noodles and boil the frozen udon for 1 minute to heat through. Drain, then run the noodles under plenty of cold tap water to cool. If you‘d like, you can place the udon in cold water and add ice cubes to chill while you prepare the other ingredients.
Make the sauce by combining 1 Tbsp mentsuyu (concentrated noodle soup base), 3 Tbsp water, and several ice cubes in a small jug with a spout.
Transfer the cold udon to a plate. Add the okra, cucumber, onsen tamago, natto, and 2 Tbsp kimchi in neat piles on top of the noodles.
Right before serving, peel and grate 1 inch nagaimo/yamaimo (mountain yam). I use a ceramic grater that I love. Note: The nagaimo may irritate your skin and cause itchiness. Work quickly and rinse your hands immediately after touching it or wear kitchen gloves. Nagaimo is very slimy and slippery, so make sure you have a good grip on it.
Immediately pour the grated nagaimo onto the udon. Top with 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds. Serve immediately. Pour the mentsuyu sauce onto the Cold Natto Udon at the table and enjoy.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and cover until you‘re ready to cook the noodles. Prepare the toppings and seasoned pork while you‘re waiting for the water to boil.
To Prepare the Toppings
Thinly slice 2 green onions/scallions. Cut 1 small bunch garlic chives (Chinese chives or nira) into pieces ⅛ inch (3 mm) wide. Set them aside.
Put 3 packets katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a Japanese mortar and grind it with a pestle until powdered.
Cut 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) into pieces ¼ inch (6 mm) square.
Peel and grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure ½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice).
Mince or crush 1 clove garlic (I use a garlic press) for cooking the meat and set aside along with the grated ginger from the previous step. Additionally, mince or crush 2 cloves garlic and set aside for serving.
Separate the 2 large egg yolks from the egg whites, if you haven‘t already. I use a slotted spoon to separate the yolks and whites of eggs that I cooked sous vide (I heated the eggs gently using an immersion circulator).
To Prepare the Seasoned Pork
Heat a large frying pan on medium heat. When the pan is hot, distribute 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil evenly and add ½ lb ground pork.
Cook the ground pork until it‘s no longer pink. Add the grated ginger and minced/crushed garlic. Stir for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
Add 1 Tbsp sake and mix well.
Add 1 Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste) and stir until combined.
Add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 2 tsp oyster sauce and mix well.
Add 1 tsp sugar and 3 Tbsp chicken stock/broth and mix. Let it simmer on medium-low heat for 2–3 minutes. If the cooking liquid is evaporating fast, add some water (or more chicken stock). Leave some cooking liquid in the pan, and later, you will add this liquid to the serving bowls to season the noodles.
Finally, taste the pork mixture and add ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, if needed. Turn off the heat and set it aside.
To Cook the Noodles
Reheat the large pot of water to a boil. Separate and loosen the fresh noodles with your hands before adding to the boiling water. Cook 2 servings fresh ramen noodles according to the package instructions. I usually cook the fresh noodles al dente (about 15 seconds less than the suggested cooking time). Stir the noodles once in a while to make sure they do not stick to the bottom of the pot.
Once the ramen is finished cooking, drain it in a sieve. Shake off any excess water.
Divide and transfer the noodles into individual ramen bowls. Next, mix 1 tsp toasted sesame oil and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in a small bowl for seasoning the noodles.
Divide and drizzle the sesame oil mixture into the noodles. Use chopsticks to loosen the noodles and coat them well with the sesame oil mixture.
To Assemble and Serve
First, put the seasoned pork with its cooking liquid on top and in the center of the noodles and create an indentation to hold an egg yolk. Next, divide and place the green onions, garlic chives, katsuobushi powder, nori seaweed, crushed garlic, and 2 Tbsp tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps) in small piles around the pork. For each serving, place 1 large egg yolk in the indentation in the pork. Serve warm. Mix the noodles and toppings with chopsticks until the egg yolk is well incorporated and enjoy.

To Prepare the Ribs
In a small bowl, mix together all the dry rub ingredients: 2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 2 tsp shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice), and ¼ tsp white pepper powder.
Remove the membrane from the underside of 3½ lb pork baby back ribs, pulling it down the entire length of the rack with a paper towel (because it‘s very slippery!). You can ask the butcher to remove it for you. The rack on the right is shown without the membrane.
Season the racks of ribs with the dry rub mixture on both sides. Here, I use UchiCook‘s Maraca Sifter. This is so convenient to sprinkle seasonings evenly!
Use the dry rub to cover all sides, and then rub in thoroughly. Set aside for 30 minutes.
To Prepare the Sauce
In a small saucepan, combine ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, ½ cup soy sauce, 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 4 Tbsp brown sugar, and 3 Tbsp honey.
Grate 1 knob ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and mince 1 clove garlic (I use a garlic press). Add them to the sauce. If you want to add ¼ tsp liquid smoke, add it now.
Cook/simmer the sauce on low heat for 30–40 minutes.
Turn off the heat. The sauce still may be liquidy, but once it cools down, the sauce will get thicken further. You will have roughly ⅔ cup of sauce after it cools down.
To Pressure Cook the Ribs
Place the metal steam rack into a 6-QT Instant Pot. Add 1 cup water and ¼ cup apple cider vinegar to the inner pot.
Put the racks of ribs sideways on top of the steam rack, wrapping and bending the ribs in a circle.
Select the Manual setting; adjust the pressure to High, and set the time for 25–30 minutes (if you want the meat to fall off the bone, select 30 minutes). If you are using spare ribs, set the time for 30–35 minutes.
When finished cooking, natural release the pressure for 5 minutes, then quick release the pressure (be careful and cover your fingers with a kitchen towel).
To Broil the Ribs
Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. When broiling, you don‘t control the temperature; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It‘s similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *Broiler setting: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use Medium (6 inches away) or High (8 inches away).
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top. Transfer the ribs from the Instant Pot to the wire rack.
Brush with the sauce on both sides of the ribs.
Place in the oven and broil until the sauce is caramelized, bubbly, and brown, about 3–4 minutes.

To Make the Dipping Sauce
I recommend making Homemade Mentsuyu for the best flavor, but you can also use store-bought mentsuyu. Most are concentrated, and every brand has slightly different instructions on how to dilute it. I explain a bit more on my mentsuyu pantry page. The brand I use recommends a dilution ratio of one part mentsuyu to three parts water, or 1 to 3.
Combine ¼ cup mentsuyu (concentrated noodle soup base) and ½–1 cup iced water in a measuring cup and mix well. If your mentsuyu is not concentrated (labeled “straight“ on the bottle), then you don‘t need to dilute it. Tip: Include several ice cubes as part of your measured water to keep your dipping sauce chilled and refreshing.
To Prepare the Garnishes
Cut 1 green onion/scallion into thin slices and grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and put them separately in small bowls. I highly recommend shiso leaves (perilla/ooba) and myoga ginger for somen, if you can find them. Thinly slice and place them in separate small bowls. Grate a small amount of daikon radish (optional), gently squeeze some of the liquid out, then place in a small bowl. Pour some toasted white sesame seeds (optional) into a small bowl. Gather all the garnishes on a tray, if desired, and set aside.
To Prepare the Toppings (optional)
To make the meal more filling, you can prepare toppings such as chicken chashu, simmered shiitake mushrooms (see next step), blanched okra, toasted aburaage, shredded thin omelette (see How to Make Kinshi Tamago), julienned cucumbers, thinly sliced Satsuma age, and cherry tomatoes. Find more ideas in the blog post.
To make the simmered shiitake mushrooms, remove the stems from 8–10 shiitake mushrooms. Cut the caps into thin slices. In a saucepan, combine the mushroom slices, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp mirin, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 tbsp water (or dashi). Simmer, uncovered, until there is almost no liquid left. Set aside to cool.
To Cook the Somen Noodles
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. (You do not need to add salt to the water.) Meanwhile, remove all the wrappings from 4 bundles dried somen noodles, as all the noodles should go into the boiling water at the same time. Tip: Somen noodles cook very fast, so it‘s important to work quickly.
When the water is boiling, add the somen all at once, spreading the noodles around the pot in a circular motion to separate each strand (I use a motion similar to opening a Japanese folding fan).
Cook in the boiling water, stirring occasionally with chopsticks, for 1 to 1½ minutes or according to the package instructions. If it looks like the water may boil over, add a small amount of cold water to the pot. When the noodles are done, drain them in a colander. Tip: I slightly undercook my noodles to keep their springy texture.
Next, rinse the somen under cold running water. Once the noodles are cool enough to handle, rinse them with your hands as if you are washing your clothes. Knead and massage the noodles to get rid of the excess oil. When you finish, transfer the somen to a large bowl of iced water with several ice cubes.
To Serve
Cold Somen Noodles are often served family style in Japan, either chilled in iced water or on a tray. To serve in iced water, keep the chilled noodles in their large bowl of water with plenty of ice cubes. Decorate with green leaves such as the Japanese maple I used here. Serve the tsuyu dipping sauce in small individual bowls or cups.
Alternatively, you can serve the somen on individual plates or a large serving platter. With chopsticks, neatly roll the chilled noodles into small bunches and arrange on your plates/platter (I used a Japanese bamboo serving basket). Place the bowl or tray of somen in the center of the table along with the garnishes and optional toppings you prepared earlier. To eat, sprinkle a few garnishes and toppings into your tsuyu, dip some somen in your sauce, and enjoy.
To Store
You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. If the noodles stick to each other under refrigeration, run them under cold water to loosen them up before serving. Ideally, you should boil the noodles right before serving so they won't lose their perfectly springy texture.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,

To Make the Okonomiyaki
We will make one Okonomiyaki at a time The ingredients are for 2 pancakes, so divide all the ingredients into 2 portions.
Heat a large nonstick griddle (I use an electric griddle at home) to 340°F (170°C). Pour ¼ cup batter onto the hot griddle. Immediately spread the batter thinly into a large circle with the back of the ladle, starting at the center and spiraling the batter outward (see the video) to a diameter of 8–9 inches (20–23 cm).
Now, start layering your ingredients. Sprinkle this “crepe“ with 1 Tbsp ground katsuobushi. Then, scatter a portion of sliced cabbage on top.
Next, top with 2 Tbsp tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), some of the sliced scallion, and 1 oz bean sprouts.
Add 1 Tbsp tororo kombu on top, if using. Then, add a single layer of 3 pieces thinly sliced pork belly without overlapping.
Pour 1 Tbsp batter on top (this will act as glue). With two spatulas, one in each hand, carefully pick up the pancake from either side and quickly flip. Turn the heat to 390°F (200°C) to cook the meat. Use the spatula to push the edges of the meat toward the rounded pancake shape. Don’t press down the crepe with the spatula yet (you will do so later). When the meat is no longer pink, turn down the heat to 340°F (170°C) and move the Okonomiyaki to the side. If you are using a frying pan instead of the griddle, heat up a second pan.
With your hands, loosen 1 serving yakisoba noodles and place them in the open space on the griddle (or the 2nd frying pan). Stir-fry until the noodles are coated with the rendered oil from the meat. Next, drizzle 1–2 Tbsp okonomiyaki sauce on the noodles and toss to coat.
Form the noodles into a round flat shape similar in size to the crepe. Using the two spatulas, quickly transfer the Okonomiyaki on top of the noodles.
Heat some neutral oil in the open space and crack 1 large egg. Quickly spread the egg into the same size as the Okonomiyaki.
Before the egg is completely cooked, place the Okonomiyaki on top of the egg (see the video).
When the bottom of the egg is cooked, flip the Okonomiyaki for the last time using the two spatulas.
To Serve
Transfer the okonomiyaki to an individual plate and drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce. Customize with the condiments and toppings of your choice. I recommend drizzling Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise in a zigzag pattern and sprinkling aonori (dried green laver seaweed) on top. Garnish with pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga), if desired. Serve immediately.

You will also need a pack of 6-inch bamboo skewers.
To Prepare the Ingredients
For the kushikatsu sauce, combine all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl: 4 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbsp ketchup, 2 Tbsp water, 2 tsp soy sauce, and 2 tsp sugar. Whisk well. Depending on the amount of skewers you‘re preparing, multiply the sauce ingredients as you need.
Boil water in a small saucepan. Gently submerge 9 quail eggs into the boiling water. Cook for 3 minutes and transfer to iced water to let cool. Peel the eggs and set aside.
Put 2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) in the food processor. Process to make the panko a finer texture.
Snap off the ends of 6 asparagus spears and discard the bottom.
Cut ½ onion into 4 wedges.
Discard the ends of 1 bunch garlic chives (Chinese chives or Nira) and cut them crosswise into 4 equal pieces.
Cut 1 piece boneless pork loin chops (½-inch thick) into 4 pieces and pound the meat with the back of the knife to tenderize the meat.
Cut ½ chicken breast diagonally (which should be against the grain) about ½ inch thick. Then, season with Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To Skewer All the Ingredients
Skewer the chicken and pork as if you are stitching, starting from one end of the meat, move the skewer downward and upward alternately.
Equally divide the garlic chives and put them on each end of the 4 pieces sliced pork belly on the cutting board. Roll the garlic chives from one end to the other. Skewer the seam so the pork belly slice will stay in place.
Carefully skewer the 2 sausages and the quail eggs.
For ½ cup sushi ginger (gari), drain it and skewer it as well. For the onion wedges, skewer them toward the core.
Prepare all the skewered ingredients on a plate/tray.
To Prepare the Batter
Whisk 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) in a large bowl. Add all but ¼ cup of the 1 cup water, leaving the rest in the measuring cup.
Then, add 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour) into the bowl. Whisk all together. With the remaining water, slowly drizzle in water until your batter is the right consistency.
The batter should be runny but thick, and when you dip your finger, it should be covered with the batter. Adjust with more water, if needed. Place the panko in a shallow bowl/tray.
To Deep-Fry
Bring 3½ cups neutral oil to 340–360ºF (170–180ºC). When the oil is hot and ready for deep-frying, you want to start with the vegetables or more plain food first, leaving the meat or strong flavor items for later. That way, the oil stays clean for the vegetables/ plain food, as the oil will turn darker and more flavorful when you start deep-frying the savory food.
Dredge the ingredients in the batter and then the panko. Remove the excess panko and deep-fry until crisp and golden brown.
Scoop up the panko breadcrumbs between batches to keep the oil clean. Burnt panko will darken your oil, which will change its taste.
Continue with other ingredients. Use a spoon, if you have a hard time coating the batter.
Deep-fry the meat and seafood at the end.
To Serve
Drain the deep-fried food on a wire rack or paper towel. Serve immediately with the kushikatsu sauce and ichimi togarashi (Japanese chili pepper).

I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need.
To Mix the Dough
In a large bowl, combine 225 g bread flour (2 cups minus 2 Tbsp), 3½ Tbsp cake flour, ¼ cup sugar, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 1 tsp instant yeast.
Beat 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) in a small bowl and add to the bowl with the dry ingredients.
Add 50 ml whole milk (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and 50 ml water (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp), both of which you‘ve kept at 86ºF (30ºC).
Using your fingertips or a wooden spoon, gently mix the ingredients together until combined. In the beginning, the dough is very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. Also, use the dough to pick up the flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. This step should take about 2 minutes.
To Knead the Dough
Dust a clean work surface with bread flour and transfer the dough from the bowl. Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold the top half of the dough in half back toward you. Rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat. Turn the dough slightly (to clockwise), fold it in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. This process is called “punching“ the dough and the goal is to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands. Repeat for 5 minutes or so. Tip: If the dough doesn‘t seem to be losing its stickiness, sprinkle more flour over the top and work it into the dough. You can lightly dust your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.
After “punching” for 5 minutes, the dough will become more elastic. Press and stretch the dough until it measures 10 inches (25 cm). Then, put small cubes of 2½ Tbsp unsalted butter on top of the dough. Roll up the dough, tucking in the butter, and then continue the kneading process.
Your hands, dough, and the working surface will get oily and messy in the beginning. I recommend using a metal/silicone dough scraper to collect the dough stuck on the working surface.
As you knead, the dough will absorb the butter and it will eventually become smoother and easier to work with.
When the dough becomes smooth, start banging the dough onto the counter and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Bang the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and “punch” it, using the lower part of your palm. Continue this process for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging onto the counter. Don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
Now, it’s time for the windowpane test. Either pull on a part of the dough or tear off a small piece. Hold the dough in both hands and gently pull it into a square with your fingers. It should be very elastic, smooth, and shiny. If it‘s strong enough to stretch to a super-thin membrane without tearing and light can pass through the center, your dough passes the test. If it doesn’t stretch or it tears too easily, knead it again for another 2 minutes and test again.
The First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)
Shape the dough into a ball by pulling all sides of the ball to the bottom and pinching them together.
Place the dough in a bowl, seam side down, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1–2 hours. I use the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Once the dough has doubled in size, use the finger test. Dust your index finger (or the top of the dough) with flour and use your index finger to poke the middle of the dough. If the hole does not close up, it’s ready for the next step. If the dough closes up immediately, proof the dough a little longer and test again.
To Divide the Dough
Press the dough with your hands to release the gas and deflate the dough.
Fold both sides of the dough toward the center.
Then fold it in thirds toward the middle. Flip, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Shape the dough into a ball, rotating (clockwise) with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Using a dough scraper, cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. If you need to adjust the size of dough, pinch off the center of the big dough and add to the center of the small dough and knead to combine well.
Shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all sides and tuck into the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
To Form the Anpan
After resting, flatten the dough balls with your hand, fold in thirds twice (just like you did earlier), and shape into balls again.
For each dough ball, press it so it stretches to a 3 inch (8 cm) diameter. From the 10 oz sweet red bean paste (anko), scoop 35 g and place in the middle of the dough. Then pull all sides of the dough around and wrap the red bean paste tightly to seal.
Pinch the seam very well and put the seam on the bottom. Place the dough on your left (right) palm, and rotate it with your right (left) hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom. Put the dough back into the baking sheet, seam side on the bottom. Continue forming the rest of the anpan.
The Final Rise (Proofing) and Oven Preheat
Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying. Let the dough rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes (I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven). When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Note: If you are using the oven to proof, you have to transfer the dough to a warmer place so you can preheat the oven.
In a small bowl, add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) and 2 Tbsp water and whisk very well. Using a pastry brush, brush all sides of the dough with an egg wash.
Put 2 tsp toasted black sesame seeds in a small bowl. Dip the flat round side of a rolling pin (about ¾ inch (1.9 cm) diameter) first in the egg wash, then into the black sesame seeds, and finally into the top of the dough to stamp it with the seeds. Alternatively, you can simply sprinkle the black sesame seeds on top.
To Bake
Bake at 400ºF (200ºC) for 13–15 minutes. Toward the end of baking if you see the bread rolls are not browning equally, rotate the baking sheet once so that the anpan brown evenly.
Once the bread is baked, transfer to a wire rack and let it cool. Serve warm or at room temperature immediately. Enjoy!

To Mix the Dough Ingredients
In a large bowl, whisk together 1¼ cups bread flour, 50 g cake flour, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 15 g sugar.
Microwave 125 ml whole milk until warm to the touch, about 95ºF (35ºC). Then, add in 1 tsp instant yeast to the warm milk.
Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the flour mixture. Using a silicone spatula, combine together until it becomes a rough dough, about 1–2 minutes.
Once the dough becomes a ball, add 10 g unsalted butter to the center of the dough and combine until the butter is well incorporated, about 2–3 minutes. At first, the dough will be sticky, wet, and oily and you might want to add more flour, but wait and try mixing it a little longer.
To Knead the Dough
Once you don’t see any big chunks of butter, transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and pliable, about 5 minutes. Read the tip on kneading below.
Tip on kneading: Using the lower part of your palm, push out the dough. Then, roll back up as if you’re drawing the number “8” with your hand. Rotate the dough 90 degrees every time you finish drawing a figure 8.
After drawing a figure 8 a few times, bang the dough onto the work surface and fold it over away from you. This helps develop the gluten (elasticity). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat drawing the number 8 again. Continue this process until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky.
When the dough is moist, smooth, and pliable, form it into a ball. Place the seam side down on the working surface and twist the ball a few times to close the seam.

Place the dough back in the bowl, seam side down. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise at 100ºF (38ºC) for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size. I used the proof setting in my oven. Tip: See my Shokupan post for tips on creating a warm environment for your dough.
To use the finger test, dust your finger with flour and poke the center of the dough. If the hole doesn’t close up, it’s ready to divide. If the dough closes up immediately, proof the dough a little longer and test again.
To Divide the Dough
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently punch/press it down.
Fold the dough into thirds widthwise.
Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise.
Turn upside down so the seam is facing down. Twist the dough to form a nice ball shape.
Weigh the dough on a kitchen scale and divide the number by 8. Roughly cut the dough into 8 pieces.
Weigh each piece of dough and cut off any extra if it weighs more than you calculated.
Add the extra dough to the smaller dough piece(s). Hide the extra dough in the center of the ball by pulling down the dough from the sides.
Twist the dough to seal the seam on your hand. Place the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.
To Roll Out the Dough
Working on one dough ball at a time, place the dough seam side up and flatten it with your hand. Fold in thirds widthwise.
Fold in thirds lengthwise, and then turn it upside down so the seam side is on the bottom.
Flatten again, and flip so the seam side is up.
With a rolling pin, roll it out into a 3½-inch (9-cm) circle. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. One by one, pick up the dough circles. Pinch the edges with your fingers to thin them out while leaving the center thicker, to about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.
To Shape the Curry Bread
Working on one dough circle at a time, place it seam side up. Gather 1½ cups Japanese curry of your choice. Add 1 to 1½ Tbsp curry sauce to the center of the circle. Do not overfill. Remember, KEEP THE CURRY AWAY from the edges! It’s the most crucial part. If you didn’t read my blog post, read tip #2 now in the post.
Gather the opposing edges of the circle and fold the dough in half. Tightly pinch and press the edges to seal well so the seam does not open up during proofing and deep-frying.
Next, to double secure the seam, fold the edges over to one side at least once, like folding a brown paper lunch bag. Press the edges again to secure.
Place the bread, seam side down, back onto the tray with the silicone mat. Cover with a damp towel while working on the rest of the dough.
Once you‘ve formed all the curry bread, crack 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) into a bowl and whisk well. Place 1 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) in a shallow bowl/tray. Using a pastry brush, coat them with beaten egg and then panko.
The Final Rise (Proofing)
Cover the bread with plastic wrap and let rise at 100ºF (38ºC) until 1½ times its size, for 45–60 minutes (I used the proof setting in my oven). If you touch the dough with your finger and the indentation remains, it‘s ready.
To Deep-Fry the Bread
If you‘re new to deep-frying, please read my post on how to deep-fry food at home for tips on safe and successful frying. In a deep-frying pot (I use a 2.75 QT Staub), heat 4 cups neutral oil to 320ºF (160ºC). Place 2–3 pieces of the curry bread into the oil, seam side down. After a few seconds, flip it over so the seam side is now up. You may need to hold it with a pair of tongs. Keep turning them while they deep-fry, until they cook to a golden brown, about 2–3 minutes. Drain the oil well and transfer to a wire rack or some paper towels to drain while it cools.

If you don't have a scale, here's how to measure flour with a measuring cup: Fluff the flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into the measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
Gather all the ingredients. I have 2 videos to help you with this recipe: The hand-kneading method and the stand mixer method. Once you‘ve made the bread dough and biscuit dough—either by hand or using a stand mixer—proceed to Steps 3–5.
Step 1: To Make the Bread Dough
Mix: Add 225 g bread flour (1¾ cups + 2 Tbsp), 25 g cake flour (3½ Tbsp), 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar to a large mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.
Add 1¼ tsp instant yeast and whisk to combine. Then, add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell), beaten.
Add 50 ml whole milk (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and 50 ml water (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp), both at 86ºF (30ºC). Gently mix the ingredients together with a silicone spatula or your fingers until combined. Tip: I highly recommend using whole milk instead of reduced-fat milk.
In the beginning, the dough will feel very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. This step should take about 2 minutes. Use the dough ball to pick up any flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. Transfer the dough to a work surface lightly dusted with bread flour.
Knead: Press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold down the top half of the dough back toward you. Then, rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press the dough flat and away from you.
Rotate the dough clockwise slightly, fold the dough down in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. Knead to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands to make the dough more elastic. Repeat this rotate, fold, and knead process for 5 minutes or so. Tip: Lightly dust your hands with bread flour to keep the dough from sticking too much. If it's still too sticky to knead, sprinkle a tiny bit of bread flour on top and work it into the dough. Add only the minimum necessary to keep it from sticking to your hands, as adding too much flour will make the dough dry and hard. Aim for a moist, soft dough that is smooth and pliable and holds a ball shape.
Knead in the Butter: After kneading for 5 minutes, the dough will get more elastic. Next, press and stretch the dough until it‘s a flat log about 10 inches (25 cm) long. Put the small cubes of 35 g unsalted butter (2½ Tbsp; at room temperature) all over the top of the dough. Roll up the dough, tucking in the butter. Then, continue to knead as before.
Your hands, the dough, and the work surface will get greasy and messy in the beginning. Don‘t panic; the dough will eventually absorb the butter as you continue to knead. I recommend using a metal or silicone dough scraper once in a while to collect the dough stuck on the work surface. Keep kneading.
Slam and Fold: Once the dough becomes very smooth and easy to work with, “slam and fold“ the dough to further develop its gluten (elasticity). First, hold one end of the dough and slam the other end onto the work surface. Bang! Next, fold the bottom end up and over away from you. Then, knead the dough with the lower part of your palm. Pick up the dough, turn it 90 degrees, then repeat this slam-and-fold process. Continue until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky, about 10 minutes. Tip: Don’t let go of the dough when you are banging it onto the work surface and don’t let it rest for too long between turns.
The Windowpane Test: When the dough feels silky and smooth, it‘s time for the windowpane test to see if the dough‘s gluten is well developed. Hold the dough in both hands and gently pull it into a square with your fingers. It should be very elastic, smooth, and shiny. If it‘s strong enough to stretch to a super-thin membrane without tearing and light can pass through the center, your dough passes the test. If it doesn’t stretch or it tears too easily, knead it again for another 2 minutes and test again.
Form the dough into a ball by pulling and tucking all edges toward the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl with the seam side down.
Bulk Fermentation: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1–2 hours. I use the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven. Tip: If you live in a cooler environment and your oven doesn't have a Proof setting, place small baking dishes of boiling water at the four corners on the lower-middle rack. Then, place your dough in a bowl in the center of the rack and close the door. The steam and heat from the boiling water will create a warm environment for bulk fermentation. If you live in a warmer environment, you may not need to do this; your proof time also may be shorter.
Step 2: To Make the Biscuit Dough
Mix: To a large bowl, add the small cubes of 60 g unsalted butter (¼ cup, at room temperature) and mash it with the silicone spatula until it becomes smooth.
Add 100 g granulated sugar (½ cup) to the butter. Mix with the silicone spatula until well blended.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell), beaten, to the bowl and blend well with the butter mixture. Then, add another small amount of beaten egg and blend. Continue until all the egg is well incorporated.
Sift 200 g cake flour (1⅔ cups) and ½ tsp baking powder into the mixture.
Using the silicone spatula, mix well until the dry ingredients are just incorporated. Collect the dough with your hands and roll it into a ball.
Divide: Weigh the biscuit dough on a scale. Remember this weight, as you’ll need it later to measure one-tenth portions of the dough. The total dough weight for 10 melon pan should be around 400–410 g.
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Divide the total dough weight by 10 to get the target weight of each piece (40–41 g, in my case). Weigh the biggest piece first. Pinch off some dough if it‘s heavier than the target weight, then weigh again. Repeat until the dough piece reaches the target weight. Repeat with the other dough pieces, pinching off a bit of dough from a larger piece or adding some to a smaller piece by stuffing some dough inside.
Pre-shape: Roll the divided biscuit dough into balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit so it‘s easier to handle. Proceed to Step 3: To Divide and Pre-Shape the Bread Dough.
Step 1: To Make the Bread Dough
Mix: Add 225 g bread flour (1¾ cups + 2 Tbsp), 25 g cake flour (3½ Tbsp), 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, 3 Tbsp granulated sugar, and 1¼ tsp instant yeast in a stand mixer bowl. Mix together with a hand whisk.
Set the mixer bowl on the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment.
Add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell), beaten, to the dry ingredients. Add 50 ml whole milk (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and 50 ml water (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp), both at 86ºF (30ºC). Tip: I highly recommend using whole milk instead of reduced-fat milk.
Start the mixer on low speed (Speed 2) to combine the ingredients. Use a silicone spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl a couple of times.
Continue to mix until the dough clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl.
Knead in the Butter: Once the dough starts to come together, add the small cubes of 35 g unsalted butter (2½ Tbsp; at room temperature). Continue to stir on low speed until the butter is incorporated and no streaks remain. Then, increase the speed to medium (Speed 4 or 6) and knead until the dough is silky, smooth, and elastic.
The Windowpane Test: When the dough feels silky and smooth, it‘s time for the windowpane test to see if the dough‘s gluten is well developed. Hold the dough in both hands and gently pull it into a square with your fingers. It should be very elastic, smooth, and shiny. If it‘s strong enough to stretch to a super-thin membrane without tearing and light can pass through the center, your dough passes the test. If it doesn’t stretch or it tears too easily, knead for another 2 minutes and test again.
Form the dough into a ball by pulling and tucking all edges toward the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl with the seam side down.
Bulk Fermentation: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1–2 hours. I use the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven. Tip: If you live in a cooler environment and your oven doesn't have a Proof setting, place small baking dishes of boiling water at the four corners on the lower-middle rack. Then, place your dough in a bowl in the center of the rack and close the door. The steam and heat from the boiling water will create a warm environment for bulk fermentation. If you live in a warmer environment, you may not need to do this; your proof time also may be shorter.
Step 2: To Make the Biscuit Dough
Mix: Set a clean mixer bowl on a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the small cubes of 60 g unsalted butter (¼ cup, at room temperature) and 100 g granulated sugar (½ cup) to the mixer bowl.
Stir the butter and sugar on medium low (Speed 4) until well blended and smooth.
Slowly add a very small amount of 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell), beaten, to the bowl and blend well with the butter mixture. Next, add another small amount of beaten egg and blend. Continue until all the egg is well incorporated.
Sift 200 g cake flour (1⅔ cups) and ½ tsp baking powder into the mixture.
Mix well until the dry ingredients are just incorporated, then stop the mixer. Take out the dough and form it into a ball with your hands.
Divide: Weigh the biscuit dough on a scale. Remember this weight, as you’ll need it later to measure portions of the dough. The total dough weight for 10 melon pan should be around 400–410 g.
Roughly cut the dough into 10 pieces.
Divide the total dough weight by 10 to get the target weight of each piece (40–41 g, in my case). Weigh the biggest piece first. Pinch off some dough if it‘s heavier than the target weight, then weigh again. Repeat until it reaches the target weight. Repeat with the other pieces, pinching off a bit of dough from a larger piece or adding some to a smaller piece by stuffing it inside.
Pre-shape: Roll the divided biscuit dough into balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes until it hardens a bit so it‘s easier to handle. Proceed to Step 3: To Divide and Pre-Shape the Bread Dough.
Step 3: To Divide and Pre-Shape the Bread Dough
The Finger Test: Once the bread dough has doubled in size, dust your index finger with flour and use it to poke the center of the dough. If the hole does not close up when you remove your finger, then the dough is ready for the next step. If the dough closes up immediately, then proof the dough a little longer.
Deflate and Roll: Remove the dough from the bowl with a silicone scraper and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough with your hands to deflate it and release any gas.
Fold the sides of the dough in thirds toward the center, and then fold the bottom and top in thirds. Flip over to keep the seam side down. Roll the dough into a ball. To close the seam line, rotate the dough clockwise with both hands while the seam line is touching the work surface.
Divide: Measure the total weight of the bread dough. It should weigh around 460–470 g for 10 melon pan. Remember the weight, as you’ll need it later to measure portions of the dough.
Using a dough scraper, roughly cut the dough into 10 equal pieces. Divide the total dough weight by 10 to determine the target weight of each piece (46–47 g, in my case). Weigh the biggest piece first. Pinch off some dough if it‘s heavier than the target weight, then weigh again. Repeat until the dough piece reaches the target weight.
Repeat with the other dough pieces, pinching off a bit of dough from a larger piece or adding some dough to a smaller piece by stuffing it inside. Knead to combine well. Pre-shape each dough piece into a nice round ball, pulling from all the sides and tuck the edges into the bottom. Place the dough on the palm of your non-dominant hand, and rotate it with your dominant hand, keeping the seam side on the bottom.
Rest: Put the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Cover the dough with plastic wrap (I use a portable cupcake holder lid) to prevent it from drying. Rest the dough for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Step 4: To Shape the Melon Pan
Roll the Biscuit Dough: While the bread dough is resting, shape the biscuit dough. Put one ball of the biscuit dough on a lightly floured work surface and flatten it with your hand.
Using a rolling pin, roll it into a 4-inch (10–12 cm) flat circle. Set aside. Continue to roll out the rest of the biscuit dough pieces.
Shape the Bread Dough: After 15 minutes of resting, the bread dough is ready to shape. First, flatten a ball of bread dough with your hand. Then, fold the top and bottom in thirds toward the center.
Then fold in the left and right sides in thirds. Pinch both ends together to shape the dough into a ball.
Pull the dough from all sides towards the seam on the bottom. Place the bread dough on the palm of your non-dominant hand and rotate it with your dominant hand a few times, keeping the seam side on the bottom. Set aside. Repeat to shape the remaining balls of bread dough.
Assemble the Melon Pan: Place a biscuit dough circle on your palm and put the bread dough ball in the middle, seam side up.
Then flip them over together so the biscuit dough is on top. Gently pull all sides of the biscuit dough down to wrap around the bread dough. Don’t cover the base of the bread dough ball with the biscuit dough. Set aside and repeat to shape the rest of the melon pan dough.
Add the Sugar Topping and Score: Put 2 Tbsp granulated sugar in a small bowl. Dip to coat the biscuit dough in the sugar; remove the excess. Using a dough scraper or knife, gently score the biscuit dough in a crisscross pattern, about ⅛ inch (3 mm) deep. I scored 3 lines horizontally and 3 lines vertically. Repeat with the rest of the melon pan dough.
Place the melon pan dough on the baking sheet, biscuit side up. Cover the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying.
Final Proof: Let the dough rise in a warm place until it increases one-and-a-half (1½) times in size, about 50 minutes. I used the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven.
Preheat the Oven: When the dough has risen halfway, preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Set the oven rack in the middle position. Note: If you are using the oven for final proofing, you have to transfer the dough to a different warm place so you can preheat the oven.
Step 5: To Bake
When the oven is preheated well, remove the plastic wrap and place the baking sheet with the melon pan dough in the oven. Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 13–15 minutes, or until the biscuit crust is a light golden brown. If they are not browning evenly toward the end of baking, rotate the baking sheet once so that the crust gets an even color. Do not overbake, or the melon pan will be dry.
Once done, remove them from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!
To Store
Once the bread is cooled completely, individually wrap it in plastic to prevent drying. Then, put it in an airtight container or bag and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to a month. Defrost overnight in the refrigerator or microwave to warm it up inside. Then, bake it in the oven at 350ºF (180ºC) until crispy on the outside.",en,True,,False,True,"JSON parsing failed: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 89 column 61 (char 5580)"

Please note that this cake requires 2–3 hours of cooling time. You can serve it either at room temperature or chilled in the refrigerator for an additional 4 hours.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Preheat the Oven
Preheat a convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with a fan, preheat a conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t heat up very well, you can preheat it for 30–60 minutes to the hottest oven temperature—mine is 550ºF (290ºC)—then turn it down to the target temperature. As for the oven rack, I used the middle position in my convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use a conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the temperature toward the top of the oven is higher. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
For 1 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan, prepare 2 rectangular sheets of parchment paper long enough to hang over the sides by 2 inches (5 cm). Place them crisscross to maximize the coverage on all sides. (You can use just one sheet instead of two if your parchment paper is extra wide.) Fold them twice into quarters, like a paper napkin.
Open the folded sheets and place them crisscross as before. Find the center point of the crisscrossed sheets. Where the creases intersect will also indicate the center of the cake pan. Center the parchment sheets over the cake pan ring, then center the removable bottom on top of the sheets.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment sheets into the cake pan, creasing the paper against the bottom and inside of the pan to fit snugly. Press and crease the paper edges down around the outside of the cake pan, too.
Gently take out both the removable bottom and the parchment sheets, which are now molded into the shape of the pan. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then, fit the molded parchment paper back into the cake pan on top of the removable bottom. Press the paper down to fit snugly.
To Blend the Cream Cheese Mixture
Place ½ lb cream cheese in a large bowl. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave it in 15-second increments until it's at room temperature.
Press down on the cream cheese with a spatula to soften it. Then, add ½ cup sugar.
Combine the cream cheese with the sugar by rubbing the mixture against the sides of the bowl with the spatula. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules dissolve. Scrape both the bowl and spatula often to ensure that the ingredients are well incorporated and there are no lumps.
In a separate bowl, whisk 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and 1 large egg yolk well.
Slowly and gradually add one-third of the beaten eggs to the cream cheese mixture. Blend completely and thoroughly, making sure the batter is smooth and without lumps before adding more egg.
Add another one-third of the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, blending completely.
Add the remaining egg and blend well. Option: To make this cheesecake with a classic flavor instead of a matcha flavor, add the lemon juice now and blend well. Then, skip to the To Finish the Batter section.
To Incorporate the Matcha
With a ladle, transfer about two scoops of the batter to a clean, medium-sized bowl.
Now, blend in the matcha. Use a small, fine-mesh sieve to sift 1 Tbsp matcha into the two scoops of batter, a little bit at a time. Stir as you go to blend the powder into the batter completely before adding more. Continue until you‘ve sifted and blended in all the matcha. Tip: Matcha is a fine powder that becomes lumpy if you add it to a large volume of liquid. Therefore, we have to make a paste with the matcha before adding it to the rest of the batter.
Mix it all together, making sure there are no lumps and that the matcha is well incorporated into the liquid. Now, it is a thick batter.
Continue to blend until the matcha batter is completely smooth and without lumps. Then, add one more scoop of the main batter and blend well to loosen up the matcha batter further.
Now transfer the matcha batter back into the main batter.
Blend the two batters very well until you have a smooth consistency.
To Finish the Batter
Next, add 4 tsp cake flour and 2 tsp cornstarch to a fine-mesh sieve. Holding the sieve in one hand, sift a little bit of the flour and cornstarch into the cream cheese mixture while you stir with a spatula. Incorporate the ingredients well before adding more. Keep sifting and blending until you‘ve added all the flour mixture. Take your time doing this. You don’t want any lumps.
Make sure at this stage that there are no lumps. Then, gradually add 220 ml heavy (whipping) cream (1 cup minus 4 tsp) while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined. Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and blend it all together.
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so you don't create any air pockets.
Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times to eliminate air pockets. With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any. Then, run the skewer through the batter to remove any bubbles.
To Bake
Since the cheesecake may overflow during baking, place the cake pan on a baking sheet, just in case. Mine never did, but I still use a baking sheet as it helps to transfer the cake pan to and from the oven. Next, transfer the baking sheet with the cake pan to the oven. Bake at 450ºF (230ºC) for a convection oven or 475ºF (245ºC) for a conventional oven. Bake until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30 minutes; please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different. The top of my cheesecake starts becoming dark at the 30-minute mark, then gets dark brown within 5 minutes. If you love a “gooey“ or “oozy“ texture, then you may bake for less time than I suggested, but you must chill your cake well to firm it up before serving. NEVER extend the bake time and thus overcook the cake, even if the top hasn‘t turned dark. The filling will curdle and you can‘t fix it. If the top doesn‘t darken within 30–35 minutes, you will probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) the next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2–3 hours. Tip: Don’t put it on the countertop directly and make sure the air can circulate under the cake pan. For example, you can place it on top of a burner grate of a gas range, if it‘s is not in use.
To Chill
You can serve the cake either chilled or at room temperature (which we like, too). For a chilled or firmer cheesecake, cover the cake in the pan with a tea towel (don‘t use plastic, as condensation may drip onto the cake), and place in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let it stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.

Center a rack in the oven. Turn on the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and preheat it well; when the cake pan goes in the oven later, you will lower the temperature to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Tip: I strongly encourage you to check your oven‘s temperature with an oven thermometer, as the actual temperature inside may differ from the display setting.Use the residual butter on the butter wrapper to grease the pan (8½ x 4½ x 2¾ inches). Then, place the parchment paper inside the pan (the paper will stick to the butter). Tip: I recommend using a light-colored pan for this recipe; your cake may bake faster if you use a dark-colored pan.
To Make the Batter
Put the 5.6 oz unsalted butter (12 Tbsp; at room temperature) in a large bowl. Use an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer) to beat it on medium speed until it is light and fluffy, about 1–2 minutes. The butter will be pale in color and have lots of little tails forming around the beaters. Tip: This process adds air to the mixture and is crucial for a light and delicate cake texture.
Add 160 g sugar (¾ cup + 2 tsp) to the whipped butter. Cream the butter and sugar thoroughly on medium (not high) speed, about 5 minutes, until it is light and fluffy. The color is pale and the sugar is completely dissolved. Tip: The sharp sugar grains cut through the butter and create the tiny air pockets that aerate the batter and cause leavening. This process is very important for the light and delicate texture of the pound cake.
Crack 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) in a small bowl and whisk well.
Add the beaten eggs, 1 Tbsp at a time, to the butter mixture and beat well after each addition. Repeat until all the egg is incorporated. IMPORTANT: You must add and blend only a very small amount of egg at a time to achieve a smooth mixture (not a curdled mixture). Tip: The eggs contain water, while the yolks and the butter contain fats. Remember, oil and water will not mix without an emulsifier (in this case, the yolks) that suspends fat molecules in water to make a smooth mixture.
If there is a slightly curdled appearance to the batter after adding the eggs, don’t worry. The emulsification is usually complete enough that the batter will become smooth when you add the flour. The flour helps to absorb some of the excess water, too.
Next, add the dry ingredients in three stages. Put 200 g cake flour (1⅔ cups), 1 tsp baking powder, and ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt in a fine-mesh sieve. Sift one-third of these dry ingredients into the bowl of the egg mixture. Switch to a silicone spatula (or use a mixer on the lowest speed) and fold the mixture by hand so you can scrape the bottom of the bowl to get any dry pockets of flour.
Now, add another one-third of the dry ingredients and fold again.
Finally, stir in the remaining dry ingredients. Fold it just until the batter is smooth. Tip: Even though we are using a low-protein cake flour, excess mixing will develop the gluten and the cake will rise nicely in the oven, then sink as soon as you pull it out. A sunken cake has a tougher crumb with dense, moist, and gluey streaks.
To Incorporate the Matcha
Next, make a paste with the matcha: Heat ¼ cup milk in a microwave or saucepan until warm (roughly body temperature). Gradually add the milk, 1 Tbsp at a time, to 3 Tbsp matcha (green tea powder) in a medium bowl. Whisk well until combined. Optionally, you can sift the matcha in a fine-mesh sieve first before mixing with the warm milk. Tip: Warm liquid is easier to blend with matcha.
Add one-third of the batter to the bowl with the matcha paste.
Use a silicone spatula to fold the batter into the matcha paste just until the it's smooth and homogenous. Do not overmix.
Now, combine the green and yellow batters to create a marbled pattern. Add the matcha batter to the original yellow batter in 6–8 separate dollops scattered around the bowl. To swirl the two batters, use a silicone spatula to scoop the batter from the bottom of the bowl and fold it onto itself while rotating the bowl a quarter turn. Repeat this two more times only.
Pour the batter into the cake pan without mixing to keep the swirl effect. Tap the pan on the countertop once to release any air pockets.
Using an offset spatula, lightly smooth out the surface of the batter without mixing too much.
To Bake
Put the cake pan in the oven. Lower the oven temperature to 340ºF (170ºC) and bake for 50–60 minutes. Tip: Every oven is different, and your cake may be done in less than 50 minutes, so I recommend that you start testing for doneness several minutes before the baking time is up. If you‘re using a dark-colored pan, the cake may bake faster and your baking time could be shorter by 5–10 minutes or more.
After 15 minutes of baking, open the oven and quickly score the top of the cake with a sharp knife. (Please read the blog post about why we do this). Continue to bake, monitoring the oven to maintain a temperature of 340ºF (170ºC).
The cake is done when a wooden skewer pulls out moist crumbs (not wet batter) when inserted near the center of the cake. Tip: To prevent overbaking, start checking for doneness several minutes before the baking time is complete.
Remove from the oven and allow the cake to rest in the pan for 15 minutes on a wire rack. Then, take the cake out of the pan to cool completely.
To Serve
Once it’s cool, you can slice and serve the Matcha Marble Pound Cake, if you wish. However, I strongly recommend serving it the next day (and up to 3 days after baking). This gives the butter time to oxidize and blend into the cake, resulting in a moister texture and allowing the flavors to meld and improve for a deeper matcha taste. Tightly wrap the cake and keep it in an airtight container at room temperature until ready to serve.
You‘ll notice some differences between this Japanese-style pound cake and a typical American pound cake. The Japanese version is lighter and less buttery than its heavier and richer American counterpart. Also, a Japanese pound cake will have a tighter crumb and firmer structure. Finally, the Japanese version will slice cleanly and hold its shape well, whereas an American pound cake is softer and will crumble and break apart more easily.

Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a 15- x 10-inch (38- x 25-cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Separate 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into egg yolks in one bowl and egg whites in another. Keep the whites in the refrigerator and the egg yolks at room temperature.
To Make the Cake Batter
Prepare a work surface with a sheet of parchment paper. To a fine-mesh sieve, add ¾ cup cake flour, ½ tsp baking powder, and 2 Tbsp matcha (green tea powder). Sift these dry ingredients onto the parchment paper.
Use the parchment paper to transfer the dry ingredients to a bowl. Repeat sifting and transferring the dry ingredients two more times (for a total of three times). Set aside. Tip: Matcha is a very fine powder that’s difficult to blend into a batter without clumping. Sifting the dry ingredients three times ensures that the matcha and flour are well blended with no lumps and that air is incorporated into the mixture so it making it easier to blend into the batter.
In a large bowl, add the egg yolks and break them with a hand whisk.
Add half of the ½ cup sugar and whisk until the egg mixture doubles in volume. When you lift the whisk into the air with some of the mixture on it, the mixture should fall back into the bowl in ribbons, which slowly disappear back into the mixture.
Next, add the cold egg whites to a large, dry bowl. With an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer), beat the egg whites until foamy.
Gradually add the remaining half of the sugar, one-third at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form and the egg whites are glossy.
Using a hand whisk, gently fold about one-third of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture until well incorporated.
Then, add the egg yolk mixture back into the bowl with remaining the egg whites. Gently fold in the egg whites with a silicone spatula until just incorporated. Tip: Rotate the bowl a quarter turn counterclockwise while you scoop up and fold the mixture onto itself clockwise.
Next, add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture. Using the silicone spatula, fold in gently until just incorporated. Do not overmix. Tip: Adding the dry ingredients last avoids overmixing, which results in a dense (not fluffy) sponge.
Add 3 Tbsp whole milk (warmed) to the batter and fold it in until incorporated.
To Bake
Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Spread the batter evenly using an offset spatula or silicone pastry scraper.
Tap the jelly roll pan a few times on your working surface to remove any air pockets in the batter. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for 10–12 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and the top of cake springs back when touched. Tip: Do not overbake it or the cake will be too dry and break when you roll it.
Remove the pan from the oven and drop the pan on your working surface once to prevent the cake from shrinking.
To Remove the Cake from the Pan
While the pan is still hot, place a sheet of parchment paper across the surface of the cake. Place a baking sheet (or a cutting board) on top with the bottom of the pan against the paper.
Wearing oven mitts, hold the two baking sheets together with the cake sandwiched in between and flip them over. Using a knife or spatula, lift the jelly roll pan to reveal the cake.
Gently peel off the parchment paper attached to the cake. This side will be the exterior of the Swiss roll, so be gentle!
Now, flip over the cake one more time: Place another “protective” sheet of parchment paper across the cake surface, then place a baking sheet on top with the bottom of the pan against the paper.
Hold both baking sheets together and flip them over so the brown side of the cake is now facing up. Remove the top pan and parchment paper.
Remove the bottom baking sheet and place the cake with its parchment paper on a work surface. Slicing at an angle, cut off ½ inch (1.3 cm) of the cake from one of the short ends. This will help stabilize the Swiss roll when rolled up.
While it‘s still warm, roll the cake: Start at the other short end and use your hands to slowly roll up the cake together with its parchment paper, finishing at the angled end that you just sliced. Once the cake and paper are rolled up, transfer to a wire rack with the seam side down.
Cover with a kitchen towel to keep it secure and let it cool completely until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes.
To Prepare the Matcha Cream Filling
When the cake is completely cool, combine ¾ cup heavy (whipping) cream, 1½ Tbsp sugar, and 2 tsp matcha (green tea powder) in a large bowl.
Beat with an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer) until firm and spreadable, so it won’t ooze out of the cake when you’re rolling it up.
To Assemble the Swiss Cake
Transfer the Swiss roll to a flat surface and unroll the cake. It’s okay if the ends curl up a bit.
Using an offset spatula, spread the matcha cream filling evenly over the cake, leaving a ½-inch (1.3 cm) border on all sides. Tip: Spread slightly less filling toward the last one-third of the cake, as the cream will pile up toward the end when rolling up.
Carefully but tightly reroll the cake with the filling inside. End with the seam side on the bottom. Secure the cake by rolling it in the parchment paper and twisting it at both ends, like a candy wrapper. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to firm up the cream.
Remove and unwrap the Swiss roll. Slice off about ½ inch (1.3 cm) of the cake on both ends to show off the beautiful swirls. Transfer it to your serving dish. Slice and serve.

Please note that this is a chilled dessert and requires at least 4 hours of chilling time, preferably overnight.
Gather all the ingredients and equipment.
You will need a medium saucepan, a medium heatproof mixing bowl to set over the saucepan, and two large bowls. Fill one of the large bowls with water and ice and make sure that the mixing bowl fits in this ice bath; set aside for cooling the egg mixture later. Also, set an instant-read thermometer near the double boiler in the next step.
Set up a double boiler. First, add 2 inches of water to the saucepan. Next, set the mixing bowl on top and check that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Set aside the mixing bowl to use for the egg mixture. Bring the water to a bare simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low.
To Cook the Egg Mixture
In the medium heatproof mixing bowl, add 3 large egg yolks, 2 Tbsp marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp of the ⅓ cup sugar. Start whisking it with a handheld electric mixer.
Set the bowl over the saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat the egg yolks. Over the next 10 minutes or so, you‘ll gently cook this egg mixture until it registers 160ºF (71ºC), when it‘s safe to consume. Keep your instant-read thermometer handy to check the temperature. Tip: At around 160ºF, your eggs may turn into scrambled eggs; therefore, I highly recommend both an electric mixer and an instant-read thermometer for this process (please read my post).
Continue to cook the egg mixture, beating it constantly. The egg mixture will increase in volume and becoming lighter in texture. It also will turn a pale yellow color.
Continue whisking. I use Speed 3 of a 5-speed hand mixer throughout this process. Continue to check the temperature.
As soon as the egg mixture reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the mixing bowl from the saucepan. Set the bowl in the ice bath to quickly stop the cooking. Let it cool for 1 minute.
To Make the Mascarpone Cream
Meanwhile, put 8 oz mascarpone cheese in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Add the cooled egg mixture into the bowl with the mascarpone.
Note: The egg mixture does get cooked a bit on the sides of the bowl from the double boiler. Do not scrape off or use this cooked egg in your mascarpone mixture.
Gently fold the egg mixture into the mascarpone until just smooth. Tip: The egg mixture will become grainy if overmixed.
Now, make the whipped cream: In another bowl, beat 1½ cups heavy (whipping) cream until foamy; you can reuse the bowl from the ice bath, but make sure it‘s completely dry. Then, gradually add the rest of the sugar.
Beat together until medium peaks form. The cream holds its shape well but is still soft and hasn’t started to become grainy. When you lift out the whisk, peaks will form but they will bend over at the end.
Now, gently fold the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture.
Fold the mascarpone cream until well combined.
To Assemble
In a small bowl, combine ½ cup water (heated to 175ºF/80ºC) and 1½ Tbsp matcha (green tea powder). Whisk together until there are no lumps. Transfer this matcha mixture to a flat-bottomed container big enough for a ladyfinger cookie to lay flat.
Gather 24 ladyfingers. One at a time, quickly dip a ladyfinger into the matcha mixture until soaked but not soggy; use a pair of tongs to flip it over to soak the other side. Then, place it on the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish. Repeat until you‘ve arranged 2 rows of 6 ladyfingers each.
Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in an even layer. Smooth out the surface using the silicone spatula or a silicone pastry scraper.
Create a second layer of cookies, dipping the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and placing them in 2 neat rows on top of the mascarpone cream layer.
Top with the remaining cream and smooth out the top. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Gather all the ingredients. Check your 2 skin-on salmon fillets for scales and tiny bones. For bones, run your fingers along the flesh surface and sides to feel for the hard tips of any bones and pull them out with fish boning tweezers. For scales, run your fingers back and forth across the skin to find any scales and scrape them off with the flat edge of a knife.
To Lightly Marinate
In a large bowl or flat tray, mix the marinade ingredients: 2 Tbsp miso, 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and ¼ tsp toasted sesame oil.
If your salmon is not cut into fillets yet, cut it into individual portions so that they cook faster and evenly. The typical American serving size is 6 oz (170 g). Then, place the salmon in the bowl with the marinade, skin side up.
Spoon the marinade on top of the salmon, making sure to coat the sides and skin. Cover and keep it in the refrigerator for 1–2 hours for fillets up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the thickest part. Marinate for 3 hours for a thicker cut. Tip: This fish is marinated for a short time, unlike Black Cod with Miso. I don’t recommend marinating the salmon overnight, as it will get quite salty.
To Broil (for thin fillets less than 1 inch or 2.5 cm thick)
Turn on the broiler to High (550ºF/288ºC) with a rack placed in the center position, 9 inches (23 cm) away from the top heating element. Preheat for 5 minutes. Tip: When broiling, you don‘t adjust the oven temperature; instead, you control the distance between the heating element and the surface of the food. It‘s similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. Meanwhile, cut the green onions diagonally into thin slices. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (since parchment paper will burn) and spray or brush the oil so the salmon skin won‘t stick.
Next, take the salmon out of the refrigerator and remove any excess marinade completely; otherwise, the miso may burn during broiling.
I take the additional step of scraping off the excess marinade with an offset spatula or butter knife (optional). Next, place the salmon pieces skin side down on the prepared baking sheet.
Broil the salmon until the thickest part of the fillet registers an internal temperature of 125–130°F* (52–54ºC), for roughly 10–13 minutes. You do not need to flip the salmon during broiling. If you prefer it medium rare, you can stop cooking at 120ºF (49ºC). *Please note that the USDA recommends cooking fish to an internal temperature of 145°F (63ºC); however, the residual heat will continue to cook the salmon, resulting in overcooked fish.
To Bake (for thick fillets)
Preheat the oven to 425°F (218ºC) with a rack placed in the center position. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Next, take the marinated salmon out of the refrigerator and remove any excess marinade completely from the fish; otherwise, the miso may burn during baking. You can scrape off the marinade with an offset spatula or butter knife if you‘d like.
Place the salmon pieces skin side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you‘re using an oven probe, insert it into the thickest part of the flesh. Tip: If you don‘t have a probe, I highly recommend getting a Thermapen instant-read thermometer.
Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and attach the probe (if using) to the oven. Bake the salmon until the thickest part of the fillet registers an internal temperature of 125–130°F* (52–54ºC), for roughly 18–20 minutes. You do not need to flip the salmon during baking. If you prefer medium rare, you can stop cooking at 120ºF (49ºC). Tip: My recommended baking time is 5 minutes per ½-inch (1.3-cm) thickness of salmon measured at the thickest part. *Please note that the USDA recommends cooking fish to an internal temperature of 145°F (63ºC); however, the residual heat will continue to cook the salmon, resulting in overcooked fish.
Take it out from the oven. Test if the salmon is cooking by flaking the flesh. If it flakes easily, it’s cooked through. To char (optional): You can broil the salmon to give it a nice char, if desired. When the salmon is getting close to the desired internal temperature, remove the probe from the salmon and oven. Then, change the oven setting to Broil on High (550ºF/288ºC). Keep the oven rack placed in the center position, 9 inches (23 cm) away from the top heating element. Then, broil the salmon for 3 minutes or until the surface is blistered and browned a bit. Note that the salmon will continue to cook while broiling; therefore, don't wait too long to switch to broil.
To Serve
Serve the Miso Salmon and top with ½ tsp toasted white and black sesame seeds and 1 green onion/scallion thinly sliced (both toppings are optional). I like to serve this salmon with Ginger Rice. Enjoy!
Optional: I always discard the marinade (that‘s why I try to use the least amount of marinade), but if you don‘t want to waste it or make too much, you can dilute the marinade with water and cook it for a few minutes. Serve it with the salmon or use it for other dishes.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of cold water with a few ice cubes.
To Make the Sauce
Even though your sesame seeds are pre-toasted, we will freshly toast them now to enhance their nutty aroma. Add 3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds to an ungreased frying pan and turn on the stove to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, lift it up and shake it constantly over the flame. Toss and turn over the sesame seeds in the pan to evenly toast them. When they are fragrant, turn off the heat and move the pan off the stove.
Transfer the toasted sesame seeds to a mortar (suribachi). Grind them with a pestle (surikogi). Leave some seeds whole for texture.
To the ground sesame seeds, add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix it all together. Set aside.
To Cook the Spinach
Once the water is boiling, add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Add the stem ends of 1 bunch spinach first, since they take longer to cook, and hold for 15–20 seconds. Tip: Salt helps keep the spinach's green color brighter.
Then, push the leaves down to submerge them in water. Blanch until the stems are no longer rigid, about 30–45 seconds. Tip: American spinach is very soft and we can eat it raw, unlike Japanese spinach.
Remove the spinach from the pot and plunge it into the iced water to stop the cooking. Alternatively, drain and run the spinach under cold running water until cool.
To Assemble

To Prepare the Potatoes
Peel 2 russet potatoes and cut them into 1½-inch (3.8-cm) pieces; I usually cut each potato into four pieces. Cut the pieces about the same size so that they’ll cook evenly.
Put the potatoes in a medium pot and add cold water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Add 2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to the pot and turn on the heat to medium high. Cover with the lid, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid a boilover. Tip: Start cooking the potatoes in cold water to heat them up slowly so they cook through evenly. While you‘re cooking and cooling the potatoes, prepare the other ingredients (see the next section).
Once the water is boiling, remove the lid and reduce the heat to medium. Cook on a gentle boil until a skewer pierces a potato smoothly, about 15 minutes.
Drain the water completely from the pot using the lid to hold back the potatoes. Put the pot with the potatoes back onto the stove over medium heat to evaporate any remaining water completely, shaking the pot constantly to avoid sticking. When there is no liquid left, remove the pot from the heat.
Mash the potatoes lightly, leaving some small chunks for texture. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl.
While the potatoes are hot, toss with 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned) and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside to cool. Tip: Why not add mayonnaise here? Because the mayo will separate if you add it to hot potatoes. Therefore, work on the other ingredients while the potatoes cool down.
To Prepare the Other Ingredients
While the potatoes are cooking and cooling, prepare the other ingredients. Bring a small pot of water to a boil for cooking the carrots and corn (next step). Peel and cut 2 inches carrot in half or quarters lengthwise, and then cut crosswise into thin slices. You may use a mandoline slicer to cut it thinly.
Once the water is boiling, cook the carrot slices and ¼ cup (40 g) frozen corn for 5 minutes. If you‘re using canned corn, you don‘t need to boil it.
Alternatively, you can use the microwave to heat the carrot for a few minutes until a skewer pierces it smoothly; don’t overcook it or the carrot will get mushy. Drain the water in a fine-mesh sieve and set aside to cool.
Add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) to the same pot and add enough cold tap water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Turn on the heat to medium and bring to a boil. Once boiling, set a timer for 11–12 minutes and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. When the timer goes off, shock the egg in cold water until cool.
Peel the boiled egg and chop it into smaller pieces. Set aside.
Peel 1 Persian cucumberleaving some skin on to create a striped pattern, and thinly slice it crosswise. Tip: If you‘re using a large cucumber, you may need to cut it in half or quarters lengthwise before slicing it.
Sprinkle ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt over the cucumber slices, knead them with your hands, and let them stand until they release their moisture, about 5 minutes. Then, squeeze the cucumber to remove any moisture and set aside. Tip: Salt draws out moisture through osmosis. This keeps the cucumber from releasing moisture into the salad and diluting the flavors.
Cut 2 slices Black Forest ham into 1-inch (2.5-cm) thin strips and set aside.
To Assemble
Add the vegetables, egg, and ham to the bowl of cooled potatoes and mix all together.
Add 4 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and combine well.
Taste it and add more mayo, if you'd like. I added the remaining 2 Tbsp Japanese mayonnaise. Instead of adding more mayo, you can also add salt to bring out the flavor. I recommend chilling the potato salad in the fridge for 30–60 minutes before serving, but you could serve it immediately as well.
To Serve
You can pair this versatile Japanese Potato Salad with just about anything. I like to serve it with Karaage (Japanese Fried Chicken) and Hambagu (Japanese Hamburger Steak). For a barbecue or potluck, see my list of Japanese recipes that go perfectly with this potato salad. It‘s a classic addition to your bento lunchbox, too!

To Make the Dashi
In a small saucepan, boil 1¾ cups water for the dashi. Once boiling, add ½ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes).
Stir and turn off the heat. Set aside for 15 minutes to steep. Then, strain out the katsuobushi with a fine-mesh sieve. Now you have Katsuo Dashi. Set it aside. Tip: Reserve the spent katsuobushi to make furikake (rice seasonings).
To Cut the Kabocha
Scoop out the seeds and membrane from 1 lb kabocha squash. Microwave it for 2 minutes to soften the outer skin. You can skip microwaving if you have a sharp knife and the strength to cut through the hard kabocha. Tip: See my tutorial and video on How to Cut a Kabocha Squash for more detailed instructions and techniques.
Carefully cut the kabocha into wedges, then 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Remember, we leave the skin on because it is edible and nutritious.
To Cook
Place the kabocha pieces in a single layer, skin side down, in a large pot.
Add the dashi, 2 Tbsp sake, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Swirl the pot to mix the seasonings so you don‘t break the kabocha pieces by stirring.
Turn on the stove to medium high and bring it to a boil.
Add 2 tsp soy sauce and ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and swirl the pot again to mix the seasonings. The cooking liquid should come three-quarters up the sides of the kabocha pieces; if it does not, you can add a little water. Bring it to a boil again.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and maintain a simmer. Place an otoshibuta (drop lid) directly on the kabocha; learn how to make it at home or find it on Amazon and JOC Goods. Cook for 20–30 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces and skin thickness. It‘s done cooking when the orange flesh has tiny, thin cracks near the skin or a bamboo skewer pierces the flesh easily. If the liquid evaporates too fast, you can cover the pot with the pot lid (with the otoshibuta still in place).
Remove from the heat. Cover with the pot lid and let sit until cool, about 30 minutes. This helps the kabocha absorb more flavor.
To Serve
You can serve the simmered kabocha at room temperature or reheat before serving. To garnish with ginger (optional), cut it into thin slices and then thin julienne strips.
Soak in cold water for 1 minute to remove some of the spiciness. Drain well. Sprinkle the ginger on top of the kabocha.

Freeze the pork belly slices for 10 minutes so that it‘s easier to cut. Tip: For the sauce, I recommend doubling the recipe, just in case. It‘s hard to measure the vegetables and meat precisely, and if you end up adding more ingredients, you‘ll need more sauce so the yakisoba is flavorful.
To Make the Sauce (yields ⅓ cup, 80 ml)
Whisk together all the ingredients for the Yakisoba Sauce: ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce, 4 tsp oyster sauce, 4 tsp ketchup, 2 tsp soy sauce, and 2 tsp sugar. At this point, it‘s important to taste the sauce and add more sugar, if needed. For example, some ketchup is sweeter than others while some Worcestershire sauce is less sour than others. Set it aside.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Remove ¾ lb sliced pork belly from the freezer. Cut the pork belly slices into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.
Cut ½ onion into ¼-inch (6-mm) slices.
Cut 4 inches carrot into 2-inch slabs. Then, cut them into julienne strips 2 inches (5 cm) long.
Remove the core from ¼ head green cabbage. First, cut the cabbage wedge into slices 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.
Then, cut the slices into bite-sized pieces.
Chop 2 green onions/scallions into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Cut any thick, white parts of the green onions in half lengthwise.
Remove the stems from 3 shiitake mushrooms. Cut the caps into ¼-inch (6-mm) slices.
To Cook the Noodles
Heat a griddle (I use a similar one; you can use a large frying pan or wok) on medium heat. When it‘s hot, add 2 Tbsp neutral oil. Then, add 3 servings yakisoba noodles. Tip: The pre-steamed noodles will come pressed together into squares. You do not need to loosen them before placing them on the griddle.
When the bottom side of the noodles is heated, flip them. The goal here is to loosen up the noodles gently without breaking them into short pieces. If you force them to separate, the noodles will break up. So be patient here.
With chopsticks, gradually loosen up the noodles. Once they have loosened up completely, transfer them to a plate.
To Cook the Yakisoba
To the hot griddle, add the pork belly slices and separate the chunks into a single layer. (If you are not using pork belly, add 1 Tbsp oil to the griddle before adding your choice of protein.) Season with freshly ground black pepper.
Stir-fry until the pork belly is no longer pink.
Next, add the onion slices to the griddle. Stir to cook for 1–2 minutes, separating the onion layers as you stir-fry.
Add the carrots and cook for another 1–2 minutes.
Add the cabbage and shiitake mushrooms. Cook until they are almost tender.
Lastly, add the green onions and cook for 1 minute.
Put the yakisoba noodles on top of the protein and vegetables on the griddle. Then, drizzle ⅓ cup yakisoba sauce on the noodles. Taste the noodles and add more sauce, if desired.
With a pair of tongs, toss to combine the noodles with the sauce and other ingredients. Keep an eye on the noodles as they may stick to the skillet/wok. When the sauce is well distributed and the noodles are warmed through, transfer the yakisoba to individual plates.

Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Then, squeeze the liquid from the dashi packet and discard the packet.
Season the dashi with 1½ Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp sugar, and ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and mix it all together. Cover the pot with a lid to keep it hot and prevent evaporation. Turn off the heat and set aside.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut the white part of ½ Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) diagonally into ½-inch (1.3-cm) slices. Set aside.

Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Base Batter
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour), ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ¼ tsp sugar, and ¼ tsp baking powder. Mix all together.
Peel and grate 5.6 oz nagaimo/yamaimo (mountain yam) in a small bowl (I use a ceramic grater that I love). Note: The nagaimo may irritate your skin and cause itchiness. Work quickly and rinse your hands immediately after touching the nagaimo. It is very slimy and slippery, so make sure you have a good grip on the nagaimo if you wear kitchen gloves.
Add the grated nagaimo and ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock) to the bowl.
Mix it all together until combined and set aside while you prepare the ingredients. If time allows, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, put it in the refrigerator, and let the batter rest for at least one hour (and up to overnight). Tip: Resting the batter relaxes the gluten, improves the flavor, and makes the okonomiyaki fluffier. Some okonomiyaki shops refrigerate the batter overnight.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Discard the core of ½ head green cabbage and cut into ½-inch (1.3-cm) slices.
Then, mince the cabbage strips. Wash the cabbage and drain well (I use a salad spinner) to remove excess moisture that could potentially dilute the batter.
Chop ¼ cup pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga). Cut ½ lb sliced pork belly into 4-inch (10-cm) pieces and set aside.
To Prepare the Okonomiyaki Batter
If you rested the base batter for an hour or longer, take it out from the refrigerator. Add 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), ½ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), and two-thirds of the pickled red ginger to the bowl. Mix until combined.
Add the minced cabbage to the batter, one-third of it at a time. Mix well before each addition.
Check the consistency of the okonomiyaki batter. Make sure the cabbage is coated well in the batter. You do not need to use all the minced cabbage if it is overpowering the batter.
To Cook the Okonomiyaki
Prepare a large griddle or two large frying pans with lids to cook two savory pancakes at a time. In the pans, heat a bit of neutral oil on medium heat. When it‘s hot (400ºF or 200ºC), add one portion of the batter to each pan.
Using spatulas, spread and shape the batter in a circle about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. We like thicker okonomiyaki (the final thickness is ¾ inches or 2 cm). If you’re new to making okonomiyaki, make it smaller and thinner so it’s easier to flip.
Place 3 slices of pork belly on top of each okonomiyaki and cook, covered, on medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
When the bottom side is nicely browned, flip them over.
Gently press the okonomiyaki to fix their shape and keep them together. Cook, covered, for another 5 minutes.
Flip them over one last time and fix their shape. Then cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes.
Transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to individual plates. Continue cooking the rest of the okonomiyaki.
To Make the Quick Okonomiyaki Sauce (optional)
Combine 3 Tbsp sugar, ¼ cup (4 Tbsp) oyster sauce, ½ cup (8 Tbsp) ketchup, and 7 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Mix all together until the sugar is completely dissolved.
To Serve
Now, it‘s time to customize your okonomiyaki with the condiments and toppings of your choice. In Japan, we spread okonomiyaki sauce on top with a brush or spoon.
Then, drizzle Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise (you can make my homemade recipe) in a zigzag pattern. Drag a chopstick tip through the mayo every ½ inch (1.3 cm) to create the iconic look.
We like to sprinkle the top with katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), aonori (dried green laver seaweed), and chopped green onions/scallions. Finally, garnish with the remaining pickled red ginger (you can make my homemade beni shoga recipe).
To Store
Wrap each okonomiyaki (without the sauce or toppings) in aluminum foil and put it in a freezer bag. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month.
To Reheat
For the okonomiyaki from the refrigerator, reheat it in a toaster oven or oven at 350°F (180°C) for 10–15 minutes. For the okonomiyaki from the freezer, you can defrost it overnight in the refrigerator or reheat the frozen okonomiyaki in the oven for 25–30 minutes. It‘s a great quick meal!

See how to cook Japanese rice with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Make the Chicken Rice
Lay ¼ onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife edge toward the root end, make ⅛-inch horizontal slices to within ½ inch of the root end, keeping the root intact. Then, make ⅛-inch vertical slices, again keeping the root intact.
Mince finely into ⅛-inch (3-mm) pieces. If you need to chop the onion pieces finer, run your knife through them using a rocking motion. Hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions will go flying around the room.
Angle your knife back and diagonally, and then slice 3 oz boneless, skinless chicken thigh along the grain into strips about ½ inch (1.5 cm) wide. Next, angle your knife again and slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ½ inch (1.5 cm) square. This sogigiri cutting technique gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the flavors.
Heat 1 Tbsp unsalted butter in a large frying pan over medium heat and add the minced onion.
Sauté the onions until tender.
When the onions are tender, add the chicken and season it with half of the Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Cook the chicken until it‘s no longer pink.
Reduce the stove‘s heat a little and add 5 Tbsp ketchup and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine. Let the excess moisture evaporate so the rice will not become mushy.
Add 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice. Use a cutting motion with your spatula to break the clumps into small pieces.
Season with remaining half of the Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add 1 Tbsp green peas and toss to combine. Remove from the heat. Divide the chicken rice into 3 portions; use 2 portions today and freeze the extra portion to use next time. Set aside. You will shape the rice before you add it to the omelette using the side of a small bowl and spatula.
To Make the Omurice
We‘ll make the omurice one at a time. Crack 2 large eggs in a small bowl. Using chopsticks, beat the eggs in a zigzag motion while you keep the chopsticks' tips touching the bowl's bottom. Cut the egg whites instead of whisking.
Add ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Then, strain the beaten eggs through a fine-mesh strainer. This removes the stringy bands on the yolks called the chalaza to give the cooked eggs a uniform and silky-smooth texture.
Heat 1 Tbsp unsalted butter in the pan over medium heat. Distribute the butter to make sure the surface of the pan is coated well.
Check if the pan is hot by adding a drop of the egg mixture into the pan with a chopstick. If it sizzles, then pour in the egg mixture.
Stir the eggs quickly in a spiral motion with chopsticks while you shake the pan. Keep the eggs moving so you end up with soft, small curds and an even exterior surface. I found that chopsticks can create really nice small curds better than a silicone spatula.
Stop stirring when the eggs are half-cooked. You want to see a smooth omelette surface, not the chopsticks’ stirring marks, so stop stirring while the eggs are rather runny. Tilt the frying pan to spread out the uncooked egg mixture. The egg curds should look creamy, soft-scrambled, and custardy at this stage. You don‘t want to overcook them, as they’ll continue to cook a little with the residual heat. Make sure to level the egg curds.
Place 1 portion of chicken rice in the center of the omelette. Spread it out to the sides a little. Create a rough football shape without moving and touching the omelette. Turn off the stove‘s heat.
Move the pan to a wet folded cloth to cool it. This keeps the omelette from browning so that your omurice is an even pale yellow color. Then, slide the omelette to the far edge of the pan. Wrap the rice with the omelette from both sides.
Hold a plate in one hand and the pan in the other and tilt the plate next to the omurice. Then, flip the frying pan upside down at an angle to transfer the omurice, seam side down, onto the plate.
To Serve
Place a paper towel on top of the omurice and gently mold it with your hands into the shape of a football or rugby ball. Drizzle additional ketchup on top or in a zigzag pattern. Enjoy!

I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the Metric button above to convert the measurements to metric. If you don't have a scale, here's how to measure flour with a measuring cup: Fluff the flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into the measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
To Make the Dipping Sauce (Tentsuyu)
Combine ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 3 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside. Tip: For a quick dashi, use ¾ cup (180 ml) water + 1 tsp dashi powder.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Peel 4 shrimp, leaving on the tail and last shell segment closest to the tail. Straighten the shrimp so it looks gorgeous; learn to do this in my post How to Prepare Shrimp. Pat dry to remove the moisture completely.
Cut 2 king oyster mushrooms (eringi), 4 slices lotus root (renkon), 4 slices Japanese sweet potato (Satsumaimo), and 4 slices kabocha squash each about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.Set aside 1 Japanese or Chinese eggplant and prepare it immediately before you deep-fry it. When ready, cut off and discard the stem and calyx, then cut in half lengthwise. Place them flat side down on the cutting board. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bottom tip intact so the eggplant stays attached, and cut the rest of it into thin, lengthwise slices about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. Gently press down to fan out the slices.
To Prepare the Oil
In a medium-sized pot, heat 1½–2 inches (3–5 cm) of neutral oil to 350°F (180°C). Tip: For enhanced aroma and taste, I like to add 1 part sesame oil for every 10 parts neutral oil.
To Make the Batter
While the oil is heating up, prepare the tempura batter. We‘ll use a 1-to-1 ratio (by volume) of flour to egg + water. First, add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) and 200 ml iced water into a measuring cup or a bowl. Whisk the egg mixture vigorously. Skim off the foam on the surface and discard.
Next, sift 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour) into a large bowl. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the flour and mix. Do not overmix; it’s okay to leave some lumps. Keep the batter cold at all times. I store mine in the refrigerator until ready to use. Make the batter right before deep-frying to avoid activating the wheat gluten.
To Deep-Fry the Tempura
Pat dry the ingredients with a paper towel, as needed. To get crispy tempura, make sure your ingredients are dry; any excess moisture will make the tempura soggy.Next, arrange the ingredients in cooking order. Start with the cleaner and less astringent ingredients. I suggest this order: Shiso, mushrooms, lotus root, eggplant, shrimp, sweet potatoes, and kabocha. We'll fry the last two ingredients at a lower oil temperature.
Check that the oil temperature is 350°F (180°C) with an instant-read cooking thermometer. To check with wooden chopsticks, dip the tips in the oil; it's ready when small bubbles form around the tips. Tip: When you deep-fry, do not crowd the pot because the oil temperature will drop quickly. Try to maintain the correct oil temperature throughout cooking. For more helpful hints, read How to Deep-Fry Food.
When the oil reaches the right temperature, dip one piece of shiso, mushrooms, lotus root, eggplant, or shrimp (in this order) in the batter. Wait until later to fry the sweet potato and kabocha. For the shiso leaves, sift 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour), sprinkle a bit on the back of the leaf, and dip only the back into the batter. The flour acts as a glue that helps the batter adhere. For the shrimp, dust lightly with the flour (or potato starch/cornstarch) before dipping. Let the excess batter drip off for 1–2 seconds, and gently place in the hot oil. Continue to dip one piece at a time and add it to the hot oil without crowding the pot. Tip: Your ingredients should take up no more than half of the oil surface area at any one time.Deep-fry until golden brown. Fry the shiso for 15–30 seconds, mushrooms for 1 minute, lotus root for 2 minutes each side, eggplant for 1 minute, and shrimp for 2 minutes.
Once golden brown, transfer the tempura to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. In between batches, scoop up the crumbs (called tenkasu) in the oil using a fine-mesh skimmer. If left in the pot, the crumbs will burn and turn the oil darker.
Now, lower the oil temperature to 320ºF (160℃). Dip the sweet potatoes in the batter and cook for 3 minutes per batch. Then, dip and fry the kabocha for 2–3 minutes per batch.
Drain on a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat until you've battered and fried all the ingredients.
To Serve
Peel and grate 2 inches daikon radish (I use a ceramic grater) and gently squeeze out some of the liquid. Prepare 3–4 Tbsp of warm tentsuyu in each individual dipping bowl with 1 Tbsp grated daikon per serving on the side.
Add the grated daikon to the dipping sauce, then dip a piece of tempura in the sauce to enjoy.
To Store
Keep the tempura leftovers in a single layer between paper towels and put in an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag. Store in the freezer for 2 weeks. To reheat, place the tempura on a wire rack in the preheated oven (400ºF or 200ºC) or the toaster oven for 5 minutes or until crisp on the outside and heated through.

Gather all the dashi and sauce ingredients. Tip: You‘ll use the dashi and sauce to adjust the seasoning of the broth as you cook. This recipe makes more dashi than you need for this dish and you‘ll likely have leftovers.
To make the cold brew Kombu Dashi, put 2 cups water and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) in a measuring cup or pitcher. Set it aside to steep for a minimum of 30 minutes, or make it ahead up to overnight.
To make the sukiyaki sauce, combine ½ cup sake and ½ cup mirin in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer and let the alcohol evaporate for a minute or so.

Transfer the sauce to a pitcher and bring both the dashi and the sauce to the table. Tip: You can make the sukiyaki sauce ahead and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.
To Prepare the Sukiyaki Ingredients
Gather all the sukiyaki ingredients. Feel free to customize the portions to suit your personal preference. Here, I used the entire package of grilled tofu (twice as much) since we love tofu.
Cut 4 leaves napa cabbage into pieces 2 inches (5 cm) wide.
Cut the pieces in half or thirds down along the thick white center of the leaves.
Cut ¼ bunch shungiku (chrysanthemum greens) 2 inches (5 cm) wide.
Slice the white part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) diagonally into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces.
Scrape off the outer skin of 6 inches gobo (burdock root) with the back of a knife. The gobo‘s flavor is just under the skin, so don‘t use a vegetable peeler and peel that flavor away. Once you scrape off the skin, shave the gobo into superthin strips using a vegetable peeler.
Soak the gobo strips in water for 5 minutes, changing the water once. Drain well.
Cut ½ onion into ½-inch (1.3 cm) slices widthwise. Next, discard the bottom part of ½ package enoki mushrooms and tear it into smaller clusters.
Cut off and discard the root ends of ½ package maitake mushrooms and separate the maitake bunch into 2 small clusters.
Cut off and discard the stems of 2 shiitake mushrooms. Optionally, you can cut a flower pattern on the shiitake mushroom caps: First, cut a sliver off the top of the mushroom cap by making 2 incisions in the shape of a “V"". Bevel these cuts toward each other by inserting the knife at an angle.
Make a second cutout in the same manner to form an ""X"" with the first cutout. You can keep this ""X"" pattern or add one or two more cutouts. Watch my video on ""shiitake hanagiri"" that demonstrates this Japanese cutting technique.
Cut ½ package broiled tofu (yaki dofu) into smaller pieces. We usually double the tofu portion and cut one block into 6–8 pieces.
If you‘d like to make flower-shaped carrots (optional), first slice 1½ inches carrot into ¼-inch (6 mm) rounds.
Here, I stamp the carrot coins with a vegetable cutter into a floral shape for decoration.
Rinse and drain ½ package shirataki noodles. Cut the noodles in half. Add the shirataki noodles to boiling water to remove any odor. Once the water is boiling again, cook for 2 minutes, drain, and set aside.
Place ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) and suet (if using) on a plate. Put all the ingredients on a big platter or bamboo tray for the dining table. I prepared my eggs sous vide (read the blog post) for dipping the cooked sukiyaki ingredients. I also cooked and drained 1 serving udon noodles and set them aside for the final course.
To Cook the Beef
Set a portable gas cooktop at the dining table. I use this cast-iron sukiyaki pot that I got from MTC Kitchen (use JOC10 for 10% off) and an Iwatani portable butane stove. Give each person a medium-sized bowl to put the cooked food from the pot.
Heat the cast-iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil (or the suet). Then, pour in barely enough sukiyaki sauce to cover the bottom of the pot, about ⅛–¼ inch of sauce.
Place a few slices of well-marbled beef in the pot. When the bottom side of the meat is cooked, flip and cook the other side. Enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and caramelized meat now to consume this good-quality beef at its best. You can eat a few rounds of meat first or leave the meat in the pot and continue to the next step.
To Enjoy with Pasteurized Raw Egg (optional)
How to Enjoy Sukiyaki in Japan: In Japan, we prepare a raw egg for each person at the table. Everyone cracks their own egg in their individual small bowl, beats it, and dips the cooked ingredients in the egg to enjoy. While raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan, US raw eggs are not recommended for consumption unless they are pasteurized. Therefore, I pasteurize my eggs using the sous vide method. When you get a chance in Japan, please try this traditional way to enjoy sukiyaki.
If you are using 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) that are pasteurized, dip the cooked beef in the beaten egg to enjoy. The salty and savory sukiyaki ingredients become mild and sweet after dipping in the egg. If you‘re not using eggs, drizzle in a bit of kombu dashi to dilute the sauce in the pot, to your liking; otherwise, it might taste too salty.
To Cook the First Round of Sukiyaki
Add some vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, and other ingredients (except the udon) to the pot. Pour in enough sukiyaki sauce to partially submerge the ingredients in the sauce, about one-third of the way or about ¼ inch of sauce. If you aren‘t using eggs for dipping, drizzle in a small amount of kombu dashi into the pot to dilute the sauce to your liking. Bring to a gentle simmer. Then, turn down the heat and simmer until cooked through. You can add more beef now, as it cooks fast. Taste the sauce and drizzle in a tiny bit of dashi or water if it‘s getting too salty.
Transfer some of the cooked ingredients to the individual bowls and enjoy the first round of sukiyaki. Taste the food and adjust the seasoning in the pot as needed; drizzle in a bit of dashi or water if it‘s too salty or add a few drops of sukiyaki sauce if it needs more seasoning. Tip: Adjusting the seasoning as you go is a normal part of cooking and enjoying Sukiyaki.
To Cook the Second and Third (Optional) Rounds
When there is less cooked food in the pot, portion what‘s left into the individual bowls. Then, start cooking the second round by adding more ingredients to the pot (repeat the previous step). While it's cooking, you can continue to eat the rest of the first round of sukiyaki or any side dishes. Eventually, you can cook a third round to finish any remaining uncooked ingredients. Tip: Continue to adjust the broth seasoning. If your sukiyaki sauce runs out, add soy sauce and sugar to the broth in a pinch. If your dashi runs out, use water instead.
To Enjoy the Finishing Course (Shime)
We usually end the sukiyaki meal with a final course (shime) of udon. When most of the ingredients have disappeared, add the cooked udon noodles to the remaining broth in the sukiyaki pot. Heat through and enjoy.
To Store

For vegan/vegetarian, make the Kombu Dashi I showed below or make Vegan Dashi with kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms.
Gather all the ingredients.
Cut 1 green onion/scallion into thin rounds.
To Make the Dashi (can make in advance)
Add 4 cups water and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) to a medium saucepan. If you have time, soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes. NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance—that’s umami! These days, it‘s pretty clean, so just make sure there are no dirt particles.
SLOWLY bring it to a boil (about 10 minutes) on medium-low heat so you can extract as much umami from the kombu as possible. Right before the stock boils, remove the kombu and set it aside for another use. (If you leave the kombu, it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste.) Now, what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you’re vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup.
If you‘re not vegetarian/vegan, add 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) to the kombu dashi and bring it back to a boil again. Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat, simmer for just 30 seconds.
Turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes. Then, strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
Now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store the dashi in the refrigerator for up to 3–5 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Reserve the spent katsuobushi and repurpose it; see the suggested recipes that follow at the end of the instructions.
To Make the Miso Soup
Add the dashi to the saucepan. If you are using dashi from the refrigerator, bring it to a slow boil (205°F/96°C) over medium heat and turn off the heat.
Add 4 Tbsp miso. Put the miso in a ladle, slowly add the dashi into the ladle, and stir with chopsticks to dissolve completely. Here, I‘m using a miso muddler. If you accidentally add too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water).
Here, I‘m using a fine-mesh miso strainer, which helps you dissolve the miso faster. After dissolving the miso in the strainer, you may see rice koji (especially when it‘s koji miso). It‘s up to you if you want to include it in the miso soup or discard it (personal preference).
Cut 7 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu) into ½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes and add to the miso soup. Tip: Add the tofu after the miso is completely dissolved; otherwise, you might break the tofu when stirring in the miso. Note: It is very common to cut tofu on your palm in Japan. However, I recommend using a cutting board if you have never done this.
Add 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed and the chopped green onions to the pot right before serving to keep their fresh fragrance and color. Tip: If you worry about salt intake, I recommend rehydrating the dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of the saltiness, instead of rehydrating it in the soup itself. If reheating, warm up the miso soup until it is just hot. NEVER BOIL miso soup because it loses flavor and aroma.
To Serve
Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting; you can read about this in my post Ichiju Sansai (One Soup Three Dishes).
To Store
In general, it‘s best to consume all the miso soup right away because it will lose its aroma and taste as time passes. Let your miso soup cool to room temperature (up to 4 hours; any longer and it will spoil) and then refrigerate. Keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch to store for later, it‘s best to refrigerate the soup without adding the miso. When ready to use, add the miso only for the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. However, you have to remove the tofu before freezing as the texture will change.
To Reheat the Miso Soup
Heat the miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but do not boil. Miso loses its nutrients, flavor, and aroma at high temperatures.

Save the spent kombu and katsuobushi in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for up to a month.

Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.
Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it‘s called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.
Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end of cooking.
Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).
Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.
Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings.
Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it‘s called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well.
To Cook the Curry
Heat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.
Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don‘t stir them too often because they won’t develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so don't skip this step. If you have extra time, definitely sauté the onions an additional 5 minutes to add more color and flavor.
Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.
Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it‘s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.
Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you‘re using my homemade curry roux, you don‘t need to worry as it does not contain salt.
Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details.
Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you‘re using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15–20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don‘t worry; we don‘t want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.
Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.
Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.
Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.
To Add the Curry Roux
Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1–2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8–12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6–7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn‘t solidified yet).
Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5–10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.
If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I recommend adding 2–4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken broth and condiments you added.
To Serve
Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).
To Store
You can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before you want to reheat it.
To Reheat
Leftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,

In this recipe, I show you two methods—one using a cast iron tamagoyaki pan and the other using a carbon steel frying pan. Although I avoid nonstick pans, it is easier to make tamagoyaki in a nonstick pan, if you‘d like to use one. Read more about tamagoyaki pans in the blog post.
To Prepare the Egg Mixture
To a measuring cup or bowl with a pouring spout (I love this HARIO bowl), add 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and ½ Tbsp sugar. I like to add 1 pinch salt as well. Then, add 1 tsp usukuchi (light-colored) soy sauce and 1 Tbsp water.
Gently “cut“ the eggs using cooking chopsticks in a zigzag motion and with the chopstick tips touching the bottom of the mixing bowl. Do not overmix or incorporate air into the eggs. For a refined texture and even coloring, you can pass the egg mixture twice through a fine-mesh sieve (optional).
To Cook in a Tamagoyaki Pan (Method 1)
Cook the first layer. Heat the tamagoyaki pan over medium heat. Dip a silicone brush or folded paper towel in some neutral oil and apply a thin layer to the pan. To check if the oil is hot enough, use the “sizzle“ test: Put a drop of the egg mixture in the pan; when you hear a sizzling sound, the pan is ready.
Pour in a thin layer of egg mixture. Quickly tilt the pan to coat the entire cooking surface with egg. Add just enough to fill the pan and don‘t overpour. For my pan size, I had enough to cook 4 thin layers of egg mixture; you may have more or fewer layers, depending on your pan size.
Pop any air bubbles (I use cooking chopsticks). Tilt the pan again to distribute the egg mixture evenly.
Once the bottom of the egg has set and the top is soft but no longer runny, start rolling the egg into a log shape with a spatula (or cooking chopsticks). Start from the far side of the pan and roll toward the pan handle. Don‘t worry about making a perfect roll at this stage.
Lightly grease the far side of the pan. Then, push the omelette back to the far side.
Cook the second layer. Lightly grease the front side of the pan. Use the sizzle test to see if the oil is hot enough. When the pan is ready, pour a second thin layer of the egg mixture to just cover the entire cooking surface.
Lift the omelette so the runny egg mixture goes underneath it. Pop the air bubbles and tilt the pan again to distribute the egg mixture evenly.
As soon as the new layer of egg is set on the bottom and still soft on top, continue rolling the omelette from one side to the other into a log shape. Use a spatula if needed. Tip: Control the temperature by lifting the frying pan rather than adjusting the stove heat. If the heat is too weak, the egg will stick to the frying pan, so be careful.
Once again, lightly grease the far side of the pan, push the omelette to the far side, and grease the front side.
Cook the third layer. Check that the oil is hot enough. When the pan is ready, pour the third portion of egg. Lift the omelette so the runny egg goes underneath it.
When the egg is set on the bottom and soft on top, roll the omelette.
Grease the far side of the pan, move the roll to the far side, and grease the front side.
Cook the final layer. Check that the pan is hot enough, then pour the final thin layer of egg mixture. Lift the omelette so the runny egg goes underneath it.
When the egg is no longer runny, roll the omelette.
Once you‘re finished rolling, press down on the omelette to flatten. Push it against the sides of the pan to shape it into a nice rectangular block. You can brown the omelette a bit, to your preference.
Transfer the Tamagoyaki to a cutting board. To help set its shape, wrap the Tamagoyaki with a bamboo sushi mat (optional) while it’s still hot. Let it stand for 5 minutes (optional) to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the egg and to cool slightly.
To Serve
To serve, cut the Tamagoyaki in half crosswise, then cut each half into thirds. Enjoy!
To Store
You can put the Tamagoyaki in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for 2–3 days and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Defrost overnight in the refrigerator or microwave.
To Cook in a Round Frying Pan (Method 2)
Cook the first layer. Heat a round medium frying pan (I use this 10¼"" carbon steel pan) over medium heat. Dip a silicone brush or folded paper towel in neutral oil and apply a thin layer to the pan. Wait until the oil gets hot enough. To check, use the “sizzle“ test: Put a drop of the egg mixture in the pan; if you hear a sizzling sound, the pan is ready.
Pour in a thin layer of egg mixture. Quickly tilt the pan to coat the entire cooking surface with egg. Add just enough to fill the pan and don‘t overpour. For my pan size, I had enough to cook 3 thin layers of egg mixture; you may have more or fewer layers, depending on your pan size. Next, pop any air bubbles (I use cooking chopsticks). Tilt the pan again to distribute the egg mixture evenly.
When the bottom of the egg has set but the top is still soft, use a spatula to fold over the left and right sides toward the center to make a rectangular shape. Then, roll the egg into a log shape. I started from the pan handle side and rolled toward the far side of the pan. Don‘t worry about making a perfect roll at this stage.
Cook the second layer. Leave the rolled omelette on the far side. Lightly grease the pan, including underneath the omelette. Use the sizzle test to check if the oil is hot enough. When the pan is ready, pour a second thin layer of the egg mixture to cover the entire cooking surface. Lift the omelette so the egg mixture goes underneath it.
Pop the air bubbles and tilt the pan again to distribute the egg mixture evenly. When the bottom of the egg has set but the top is still soft, fold the sides toward the center to the same width as the omelette. Roll the omelette into a log shape.
Lightly grease the pan again and use the sizzle test to check if the oil is hot enough.
Cook the final layer. When the pan is ready, pour a final thin layer of the egg mixture to cover the entire cooking surface. Lift the omelette so the egg mixture goes underneath it. When the egg is no longer runny, fold the sides toward the center and roll the omelette into a log shape.
Press down on the Tamagoyaki to flatten. You can brown the omelette a bit, if you‘d like. Remove from the pan onto the cutting board. To help set its shape, wrap the Tamagoyaki with a bamboo sushi mat (optional) while it’s still hot.

Please note that this recipe requires 30 minutes of inactive resting time (patties in the refrigerator) in addition to the total active cooking time.
Gather all the ingredients. If doubling the recipe, please cook one batch at a time in the pan.
To Make the Hambagu Patties
Mince ½ onion finely (we call this cutting technique mijingiri in Japanese). Lay the cut onion flat side down on the cutting board. With the knife tip pointing toward the root end, make ⅛-inch vertical slices to within ½ inch of the root end. With the knife edge toward the root end, make ⅛-inch horizontal slices, again keeping the root intact.
Finally, make perpendicular cuts down through the vertical slices you made. If you need to chop the onions finer, run your knife through them using a rocking motion. Hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions will go flying around the room.
Heat a large pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Then, add the onions.
Sauté the onions until tender and almost translucent. Transfer to a large bowl and let it cool.
Once the onions are cool, add ¾ lb ground beef and pork combination to the bowl. Add ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper as you like, and ½ tsp nutmeg. Tip: You can make hambagu with 100% beef, but it will not be as juicy and tender as combining the two meats.
Add the ⅓ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), 2 Tbsp milk, and 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell).
Start mixing it all together with a silicone spatula or spoon.
Then, switch to mixing by hand and knead the mixture until it‘s sticky and pale.
Divide the mixture into 4 portions (4 oz, 113 g each) or 6 smaller portions. Scoop out one portion.
Toss it from one hand to the other repeatedly about five times in order to release any air inside the mixture (see the video link above). Tip: Without releasing the air inside, the hamburger steaks will likely crack while cooking.
Make an oval-shaped patty and place on a tray or plate. Repeat with the remaining portions. Cover the patties with plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the meat combines well and the fat solidifies.
To Cook the Hambagu
Heat a large pan over medium heat. (Cook one batch at a time if you‘re doubling the recipe.) When the pan is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Place the patties gently into the pan. Indent the center of each patty with two fingers because the centers will rise with the heat.
Cook the patties until browned on the bottom side, about 3 minutes. Then, carefully flip and cook for another 3 minutes until browned.
Add 3 Tbsp red wine and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 5–7 minutes to thoroughly cook the inside of the patties (adjust the cooking time depending on the thickness of the patties).
Uncover and check that it‘s fully cooked by inserting a skewer; if clear juice comes out, it‘s done. Increase the heat to medium to let the alcohol finish evaporating. When it’s almost finished, transfer the hamburger steaks to individual plates. Do not wash the pan as you will make the sauce next using the pan juices.
To Make the Red Wine Reduction Sauce
To the same frying pan, add the ingredients for the sauce (for one batch): 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, 3 Tbsp ketchup, and 3 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce. Tip: Since some ketchup is sweeter than others, adjust the amount to taste. For the tonkatsu sauce, you can substitute Worcestershire sauce and sugar in a pinch.
Add 3 Tbsp red wine and 3 Tbsp water to the pan.
Mix well together and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat; let the alcohol evaporate.
When the sauce thickens (and you can draw a line on the bottom of the frying pan with a spatula), remove from the heat. Drizzle some sauce over the hamburger steaks.
To Serve
Pour the remaining sauce into a small bowl or jar and bring it to the table for serving. We typically serve Steamed Rice, Homemade Miso Soup, Crispy Baked Potato Wedges, sauteed carrots, and steamed broccoli or a salad with this meal. Hambagu also goes well with Japanese Potato Salad and Corn Potage (Japanese Corn Soup).

To Prepare the Ingredients
Cut 1 onion in half, and cut each half into ½-inch (1.3 cm) wedges.
Peel 1 carrot and cut it into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Here, I use a Japanese cutting technique called rangiri where we cut the carrot diagonally while rotating it a quarter turn between cuts. This helps to create more surface area so it will cook faster and absorb more flavor.
Cut each of the 3 Yukon gold potatoes into quarters. Tip: Yukon golds keep their shape better during simmering, but I sometimes use russet potatoes, which tend to break easily but absorb flavors nicely.
Remove the sharp edges of the potatoes with a knife to create smooth corners. Then, soak the potatoes in water to remove the starch. Tip: We call this Japanese cutting technique mentori. This prevents the potatoes from breaking into pieces. If the potatoes have sharp edges, they are likely to bump into each other and break while simmering.
Remove the strings from 8 pieces snow peas.
Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt. Add the snow peas.
Blanch them in the boiling water for 1 minute and take them out. Keep the water boiling.
Drain 1 package shirataki noodles and cut them roughly in half. Blanch the noodles in the pot of boiling water for 1 minute to remove any odor.
Drain well and set aside. Cut the thinly-sliced beef in half or thirds (depending on the size) so that the pieces are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.
To Cook the Nikujaga
Preheat a large pot or Dutch oven (I used a 4-QT Staub cocotte) on medium heat. Then, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and sauté the onion wedges.
When the onion wedges are coated with oil, add ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) and cook until no longer pink.
Add the potatoes and coat them well with the cooking liquid. Tip: This coating will help keep the potatoes from breaking.
Add the carrot pieces and shirataki noodles and mix everything together.
Add 2 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), making sure there‘s enough liquid to almost cover the ingredients (it doesn‘t have to fully cover the ingredients). If there‘s not enough liquid, add water.
Cover with a lid and continue to cook. Once boiling, skim the scum and foam from the surface with a fine-mesh skimmer.
Add 1 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp sake, 4 Tbsp soy sauce, and 4 Tbsp mirin.
Mix it all together and place an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top of the ingredients.
Simmer on low heat for 12–14 minutes, or until a skewer pierces a potato easily. Tip: The otoshibuta holds the ingredients in place and is necessary to maintain the shape of the vegetables. They bump into each other and break easily when they are loose. Do not mix the ingredients while cooking; the otoshibuta will help distribute the cooking liquid and its flavors.
Turn off the heat and remove the otoshibuta. Ideally, let the Nikujaga rest (uncovered) for 30–60 minutes before serving. The flavors will soak into the ingredients while cooling down.
To Serve
When you are ready to serve the Nikujaga, add the blanched snow peas to the pot and cover to reheat on medium heat. When simmering, reduce the heat and let it simmer for a few minutes. Tip: Add the snow peas right before serving to keep their bright color.
Turn off the heat and serve the Nikujaga with some cooking liquid in a large serving bowl or individual bowls.
To Store
You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container or in the pot and store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days. Nikujaga tastes even better on the second day!

To measure 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice, overfill a US cup measure (a ¾-cup measure works well for this) or a rice cooker cup with uncooked short-grain rice and level it off. Put the rice in a large bowl. Repeat until you have the amount of rice you need. Tip: Please note that 2¼ cups (450 g, 3 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 6⅔ cups (990 g) of cooked white rice. This is enough for 9 onigiri rice balls (typically 110 g each). One cup of cooked white rice weighs about 5.3 oz (150 g).
Next, rinse and wash the short-grain white rice and cook it with a rice cooker, pot over a stove, Instant Pot, or donabe. Please follow the detailed instructions in any one of these posts for how to rinse and cook the rice. Here, I‘m adding 2½ cups water to the drained rice in a rice cooker. Tip: The rice-to-water ratio is 1 to 1.1 (or 1.2) for Japanese short-grain white rice. This rice requires a soaking time of 20–30 minutes. Please read this blog post for a detailed explanation.
To Prepare the Onigiri Fillings
While the rice is cooking, let‘s prepare the ingredients for the fillings.
Japanese Salted Salmon Filling: Place 1–2 fillet salmon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil (for broiling) or parchment paper (for baking). Sprinkle Diamond Crystal kosher salt on both sides. Tip: This is a quick version of salted salmon; for the traditional method, see my Japanese Salted Salmon recipe.
Broil or bake at 425ºF (218ºC) in a toaster oven or standard oven for 10–20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked until well done (you want it dry and flaky). Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.
Okaka Filling: Put 1 packet katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 1 Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine. The katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in the soy sauce.
Tuna Mayo Filling: Put 1 (5-ounce) can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil), drained, in a bowl. Add 2 Tbsp Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine.
Umeboshi Filling: Remove and discard the seed from 2 umeboshi (Japanese pickled plum) and put the umeboshi flesh on a small plate or bowl.
Mentaiko Filling: Cut 2 sacs spicy salted pollock roe or cod roe (karashi mentaiko) in half and squeeze out the roe from the sacs with your hands or a knife. Set aside on a small plate or bowl.Shio Kombu Filling: Put the prepared shio kombu in a bowl for easy access later.
To Shape the Onigiri
Gather all the ingredients to make the onigiri and a bowl filled with water for your hands. If you are shaping the onigiri with your hands, transfer the freshly cooked rice to a large bowl, baking sheet, or sushi oke (hangiri) and let it cool slightly until it‘s cool enough to handle. The rice should be warm when making onigiri.
Method 1: With an Onigiri Mold
Prepare another bowl filled with water. Soak the onigiri mold and lid in the water to moisten so the rice doesn‘t stick to it. Remove the mold and drain the excess water. Next, sprinkle salt in the moistened mold. Salt is used not only for seasoning but also for food safety.
Fill it halfway with warm rice, making sure the rice is filled to the corners. Add a spoonful of your filling of choice.
Fill the rest of the mold with more rice, all the way to the edges. Sprinkle the top of the rice with more salt.
Cover with the lid and push down firmly. You should feel a slight resistance to it; if not, you may want to add a bit more rice. Remove the lid, flip the mold over, and push the “button” to release your onigiri onto a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining rice. Tip: Always dip your fingers in water before touching the onigiri to prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers.
Method 2: With Your Hands
First, wet both of your palms with a bit of water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands. Then, apply some Diamond Crystal kosher salt and spread it on both palms. How much salt? I dip 2–3 fingers in the kosher salt, as pictured below. If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it’s saltier than kosher salt.
Scoop a handful (about ⅓ cup, 50 g) of slightly cooled but still hot rice onto your left (non-dominant) hand. Tip: Your left hand holds the rice ball and flattens the onigiri’s sides. Always keep it underneath the onigiri. Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Add 1–2 tsp of one kind of filling inside.
Scoop some more rice (another ⅓ cup, 50 g) to cover your filling completely. Mold the rice with your hands and gently press the rice around the filling to form the rice into a ball.
Bend your right (dominant) hand slightly to form a “mountain” shape and place it on top of the rice. Your right hand forms the triangle corners of the onigiri. Always keep it on top of the rice ball.Gently press the rice with your top hand to make a triangle corner. Tip: Make your hands just firm enough so the onigiri doesn’t fall apart, but don’t squeeze too tightly. Try to keep the density of the rice ball as airy as possible.At the same time, squeeze the fingers and heel of your bottom (left) hand on either side of the onigiri to gently press the sides flat.Now, rotate the triangle corner you just made toward you. I use a single upward motion to barely toss the rice ball in my bottom hand while I use my top hand to rotate it toward me clockwise (since I’m right-handed). The first corner will now point at you while the tip of the second corner points up.Repeat the “press and rotate” steps to form the second and third triangle corners. Then press and rotate 2–3 more times to finish shaping the triangle.
Turn the rice ball on its side and press gently to flatten one side; repeat on the other side. Then, press and rotate one last time. Transfer to a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining rice.
Method 3: Using Plastic Wrap
If you don‘t want to touch the rice with your bare hands, you can use this method. Also, use this method when you are packing onigiri for lunch. Place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl (or any small bowl) and sprinkle some Diamond Crystal kosher salt (remember, salt is used here to preserve the rice for a long time).
Put the rice on top. If you‘d like to add a filling, create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1–2 tsp) inside.
Then, scoop some more rice to cover your filling completely and sprinkle some salt on top.
Gather the corners of the plastic wrap and twist the plastic a few times to tighten it around the rice.
Form the rice into a triangle shape in the same manner that I described above. Garnish with furikake and/or nori, if desired.
To Coat with the Furikake
Remember, dip your fingers before touching the onigiri to prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers.
Coat the three sides of the onigiri with furikake (rice seasoning).
To Wrap with the Nori and Serve
Toast 3 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) over an open flame one by one.
Then, cut them into thirds, parallel to the lines on the nori sheet.
Style A: Wrap a strip of nori on one side of the onigiri. For this style, you may need to cut the nori into shorter and narrower strips.
Enjoy the onigiri warm or at room temperature.
Style B: Wrap the onigiri with a piece of nori seaweed. If you like crispy nori, then wait to wrap the nori until right before consuming the onigiri. Make sure to keep the nori in an airtight container or bag so it will not get stale.
Place a little bit of each filling on the tip of the onigiri so you can identify which filling is inside. Enjoy the onigiri warm or at room temperature.

If you‘d like to pack Onigiri for your lunch, keep it cool and consume it within 6 hours. Onigiri (or any rice dish) gets hard when you refrigerate it. The cold air makes the rice dry and hard. I don‘t recommend making onigiri too far ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen towels and store it in the fridge. The onigiri will be cool and safe but should not get cold.
If your onigiri has dried out a bit, you can grill it in a frying pan and baste it with soy sauce to make Yaki Onigiri.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,

For the steamed rice, please note that 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked rice, enough for 2 donburi servings (3⅓ cups, 500 g). See how to cook short-grain rice with a rice cooker, pot over the stove, Instant Pot, or donabe.
This recipe includes both cooking methods—using a medium frying pan (about 10 inches/25 cm) and an oyakodon pan or small frying pan (8 inches/20 cm). Typically, oyakodon is made individually for each serving using an oyakodon pan, which lets you slide the cooked ingredients onto the rice bowl easily. See the separate cooking instructions below.
Gather all the ingredients. Do not make more than two servings in a medium frying pan. I explained a bit more in the blog post (under Oyakodon Cooking Tips). If you are making four servings, use two medium frying pans.
To Prepare the Seasonings
Combine ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Slice ½ onion lengthwise, about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide.
Chop 4 sprigs mitsuba (Japanese parsley) ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.
Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from 10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs with the knife.
Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to the cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) square. This sogigiri cutting technique gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the flavors.
Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp sake. Set aside for 5 minutes.
Crack 3-4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to “cut“ them 5–6 times into a few smaller clumps. This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs together. Tip: Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs in your finished dish.
While “cutting“ the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some of the egg yolks. That‘s okay. If the yolks haven‘t broken yet, you can poke them to gently break them, but do not blend the egg whites and yolks. The eggs should resemble a marble pattern.
To Cook the Oyakodon in a Medium Frying Pan
With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan (I use a well-seasoned 11” carbon steel pan) in a single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.
Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.
Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. Tip: Evaporation reduces the sauce and intensifies the flavor.
We will add the eggs in two stages: Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, avoiding the edges of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. Tip: Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with Egg Drop Soup. Also, try to add more egg whites at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites are taking a long time to set.
When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the mitsuba (or green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan). Tip: For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute more egg yolks so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.
Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top.
To Cook the Oyakodon in an Oyakodon Pan or a Small Frying Pan
Cook the chicken and egg in two batches, one serving at a time. Make sure to divide the ingredients in half. With the stove off, add half of the sliced onions to the pan in a single layer. Add half of the seasonings mixture (it should just cover the onions).
Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add half of the chicken on top of the onions.
Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for 4 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. Tip: Evaporation helps to reduce the sauce and intensify the flavor.

To see the metric measurements, click the Metric button above. The ratio of white rice to water is 1 : 1.1 (or 1.2). I cooked this recipe in my Hario donabe, but you can use a rice cooker (same measurements, and start cooking as usual) or a heavy-bottomed pot (for better heat distribution).
To Rinse the Rice
To a large bowl, add 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice and just enough water to completely submerge the rice. Then, discard the water immediately (so the rice doesn‘t absorb the cloudy water). Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so don‘t let the rice absorb the first few rounds of water.
Use your fingers to gently wash the rice in a circular motion for 15–20 seconds.
Add water to rinse, then discard the water. Repeat this process a couple of times until the water is nearly clear.
When the water is almost clear, drain well. Tip: Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off the excess water.
To Prepare the Corn
Peel away the outer leaves from the 2 ears sweet corn until only one thin layer of inner leaves remains. Grasp the top of the leaves and the tassel together in one hand and pull them straight down in one firm tug, inverting the husk from the cob. Break off the leaves and silks from the ear‘s base and discard them. Pick away any remaining silks. Rinse under cold running water.
Lay the corn cob on the cutting board and hold it steady. Use a sharp knife to slice off the kernels in long, downward cuts. You can also use a corn kernel peeler, but I prefer using a knife for this task. Once you‘ve cut off all the kernels, cut the cobs in half or smaller pieces (so they fit in your pot).
To Prepare the Corn Rice
In a measuring cup, add 2 Tbsp sake and 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and then add 2⅓ cups water. You should have a total of 2½ cups (600 ml) cooking liquid. Tip: If you like well-seasoned rice, you can increase the soy sauce, but make sure to reduce the water by the same amount so your total cooking liquid is still 2½ cups (600 ml).
Add the well-drained rice in a heavy-bottomed pot or donabe (or rice cooker pot). Then, add the cooking liquid that you just measured.
Add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and mix well. Level the rice so the surface is evenly flat.
Add the corn kernels on top in an even layer. DO NOT MIX with the rice. The rice will not cook evenly if mixed with other ingredients.
Put the cobs on top of the corn and close the lid. Let the rice soak for 20–30 minutes before cooking. It‘s important to soak Japanese short-grain rice so the rounded grains absorb moisture to the core and cook evenly.
To Cook the Corn Rice
Start cooking on medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once it‘s boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 13–15 minutes.
Turn off the heat and remove from the stove. DO NOT OPEN THE LID. Leave the lid on and let it steam for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, open the lid and remove the cobs.
Sprinkle with ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper and add 2 Tbsp unsalted butter on top. Drizzle with additional soy sauce, if desired.
To Serve
Cover the lid and bring the pot to the table. Gently fluff the rice and serve immediately.

Gather all the ingredients. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need.
Make sure the eggs and butter are at room temperature. Sift the cake flour at least twice.
To Prepare the Pan, Oven, and Double Boiler
Place an 8-inch (20-cm) cake pan on top of parchment paper, trace around the pan, and cut out 1 circle. Grease one side of the parchment paper and both the bottom and sides of 1 cake pan with 1 Tbsp butter. Then fit the parchment paper in the cake pan, greased side up. I avoid parchment paper on the sides because sometimes it pulls the batter and affects the final result of the cake.
Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). It’s always better to preheat longer, preferably 15–20 minutes extra. Tip: You preheat the oven so that all the surfaces inside your oven (walls, floor, door, and racks) are the desired cooking temperature. This makes for an even temperature throughout the oven and you won’t lose as much heat when you open the door for a few seconds. Depending on your oven, preheating might take 10 to 20 minutes.
Prepare a double boiler. If you have never done this before, please see the Notes section below. Turn on the stove’s heat to high and bring the water in the saucepan (Pot A) to a rapid boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Put 3 Tbsp unsalted butter in the small bowl (Bowl #1) and set over the saucepan. Let the butter melt gently.
Once the butter is melted, remove the bowl from the saucepan. Then add 2 Tbsp whole milk and whisk to combine. Set aside to keep it around 104ºF (40ºC). Tip: I highly recommend using whole milk instead of reduced-fat milk. I’ve tried using both and concluded that whole-fat milk makes a difference in the final result.
To Make the Sponge Cake (can make a day ahead)
In a stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2), add 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and break the egg yolks and whites with your whisk.
Add ½ cup sugar (½ cup + 2 Tbsp, to be precise) and whisk to combine.
In a large pot (Pot B), bring about 2 inches of water to 140ºF (60ºC) and maintain the temperature. Then, set the stand mixer bowl (Bowl #2) directly over the pot and whisk constantly so the eggs don’t scramble. This is called a bain-marie or water bath, where you set the bowl of food directly over a larger container of simmering water to temper the heat for gentle, even cooking. You can also use the double boiler method, where you set the egg mixture bowl (Bowl #2) over Pot B. The bowl doesn’t touch the simmering water of the pot.
Whisk until the temperature of the egg mixture reaches 104ºF (40ºC). Remove Bowl #2 from Pot B and set it up on the stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
Whisk on high speed (Speed 10) until the mixture is fluffy, for about 2 minutes. The batter should be loose yet thick and glossy.
When the batter is pale, fluffy, and tripled in volume, reduce the speed to low (Speed 4) for several seconds. Stop the mixer and lift some of the batter with the whisk to check the consistency. If the batter falls off your whisk in a solid line or ribbon on top of the mixture, you’ve reached the “ribbon stage” (see Notes). Remove the bowl from the stand mixer.
Add half of the 1 cup cake flour to the bowl. Using the whisk, fold gently but thoroughly. Do this by rotating your bowl slowly while simultaneously moving your whisk in a down-and-over motion.
Add the rest of the flour and fold gently to make sure all the flour is incorporated quickly so your mixture doesn’t deflate.
With your spatula, take out one scoop of the batter from the bowl and add it to the butter and milk mixture. Tip: If we add the butter and milk mixture into the entire cake batter, the fat in the butter will deflate the batter.
Incorporate the butter and milk mixture into a small amount of the batter first before adding it to the entire cake batter.
Add the mixture back into the cake batter by pouring it over a silicone spatula. This prevents the mixture from deflating the batter and helps disperse the mixture. Gently fold until incorporated. When you lift the spatula, the batter should fall like a ribbon.
Pour the batter into the center of the cake pan, from right above the cake pan. You want to avoid introducing extra air into the batter at this point. Collect the leftover batter in the bowl and pour it around the edges of the cake pan, not the center.
Firmly tap the cake pan on the counter to release air bubbles in the batter.
To Bake
In the preheated oven, bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 20–25 minutes. Check if the sponge cake is done by inserting a skewer in the middle; if it comes out clean, the cake is ready. While the cake is baking, start preparations for the cake assembly (see below).
As soon as you take out the cake pan from the oven, drop it on the counter to “shock” the cake so it stops shrinking. Separate the cake from the pan by running a sharp knife or offset spatula around the sides.
Take the cake out of the pan by placing the wire rack on top and flipping the cake over onto the rack.
Immediately remove the parchment paper.
Place another wire rack on top and flip it back over. The top of the cake is now facing up.
Cover the cake with a damp towel until cooled to keep moisture in the cake. Make sure the towel is thin (not heavy) and wring the water out well so that the towel is damp, not wet. I use IKEA’s thin dish towel. If you keep the sponge cake for later use, wrap it with plastic wrap after it‘s completely cooled and keep it in the fridge (see Notes). Tip: You can make the sponge cake the day before. It actually tastes better and it's easier to slice the cake in half.
To Prepare the Strawberries and Syrup (While the Cake is Baking)
While the cake is baking, divide 1 lb strawberries into 2 groups, one for the decoration and the other for the filling. Keep the beautiful, same-sized strawberries for the decoration. Remove the husk and clean the strawberries with a damp paper towel (do not wash, as we don’t want the strawberries to be moist and become moldy). Slice off the core for all the strawberries.
For the strawberries that we will use for the decoration, cut them in half lengthwise. For the strawberries that we will use for filling, slice them lengthwise into ¼-inch (5 mm) slices.
To make the syrup, combine 2 Tbsp water, 3 Tbsp sugar, and 1 Tbsp liquor of your choice (optional) in a small bowl (Bowl #3). Microwave for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar.
To Make the Fresh Whipped Cream (While the Cake is Cooling)
While the cake is cooling, prepare an ice bath by placing ice cubes and water in a large bowl (Bowl #4). Place a clean and dry mixing bowl (Bowl #2) in the ice bath and add 2 cups heavy (whipping) cream and 3 Tbsp sugar to keep it cold. Tip: For the perfect sweetness, the sugar should be 8% of the heavy cream weight.
Transfer the mixing bowl to the stand mixer and whisk on high speed. The cream will become thicker and smooth. When you lift the whisk out of the cream while it’s still liquid, and the cream holds its shape as it drops, it’s ready. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and put it back in the ice bath.
To Assemble the Cake
With a serrated knife, slice the cooled cake horizontally into half to make 2 layers (top and bottom).
Place the bottom of the cake on the cake circle. Brush the syrup on the top and sides of the bottom layer. This will help the sponge cake stay moist.
Using a hand whisk, whisk only the cream at one spot by the edge of the bowl instead of whisking the entire bowl of cream. We will make the whipped cream as we need it. With this approach, we can also control the stiffness of the whipped cream.
When the cream at the edge of the bowl reaches medium peaks, transfer it to the top of the bottom cake layer. Medium peaks mean when you lift the whisk, the cream will hold its shape, but the tip of the peaks will fold back on itself.
Spread the whipped cream evenly. If you don’t have enough whipped cream, whip more and add it onto the cake.
Place the sliced strawberries on top of the whipped cream as you see in the pictures. Keep the center area open by not covering it with strawberries. This will make it easier to cut the cake into slices.
Whip the cream again at the edge of the bowl.
Transfer the whipped cream to the top of the strawberry layer. Spread just enough cream to cover the strawberries; do not add too much.
Place the top layer of the sponge cake over the bottom layer. Brush the syrup on the top and sides of the sponge cake.
Whip more cream and place it on top of the cake.
Place the tip of the offset spatula in the center of the cake at a 30-degree angle and turn the cake turntable toward you to create a smooth top. Lightly coat the sides of the cake with a thin layer of whipped cream.
Now add more cream to the sides, little by little. Place the offset spatula at a 90-degree angle and push the turntable away from you.
Remove the excess cream from the cake and put it back into the bowl.
To Decorate the Cake
For a basic decoration, I use a Wilton 2A decorating tip. Put the tip in the piping bag and cut off the tip so the metal will show from the bag. Fold the top half of the bag outward as you see in the picture (over your hands).
Whip the cream to stiff peaks. When you lift the whisk, the peaks will hold firm. Put the cream into the piping bag. Once you fill the bag halfway, lift up the top half of the bag and push the cream down toward the tip.
Squeeze the piping bag to test to make sure the cream comes out smoothly. When you’re ready, hold the piping bag at a 90-degree angle and squeeze about a 1-inch-wide ring of whipped cream around the top edge of the cake. This will be the base for the strawberries.
Decorate and place the strawberries cut-side down on top of the whipped cream. Then squeeze small dollops of whipped cream between and around all the strawberries. Place 10 blueberries between the whipped cream dollops. Place 2 sprigs mint leaves as desired to add color.

Please note that this cake requires 2–3 hours of cooling time. You can serve it either at room temperature or chilled in the refrigerator for an additional 4 hours.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Preheat the Oven
Preheat a convection oven (with fan) to 450ºF (230ºC). If you don’t have an oven with a fan, preheat a conventional oven to 475ºF (245ºC). If your oven doesn’t heat up very well, you can preheat it to the hottest oven temperature (mine is 550ºF (290ºC)) for 30–60 minutes, then turn it down to the target temperature. As for the oven rack, I used the middle position in my convection oven (the fan circulates the air, so the middle rack is ideal). If you use a conventional oven, move the rack slightly higher as heat rises and the temperature toward the top of the oven is higher. However, keep in mind that a 3-inch deep cake pan needs extra space for rising.
To Prepare the Cake Pan
Prepare two rectangular sheets of parchment paper long enough to hang over the sides of one 6-inch (15-cm) round cake pan by 2 inches (5 cm). Place them crisscross to maximize the coverage on all sides. (You can use just one sheet per cake pan if your parchment paper is extra wide.) Fold them twice into quarters, like a paper napkin.
Open the folded sheets and place them crisscross as before. Find the center point of the crisscrossed sheets. Where the creases intersect will also indicate the center of the cake pan. Center the parchment sheets over the cake pan ring, then center the removable bottom on top of the sheets.
Press down the removable bottom and the parchment sheets into the cake pan, creasing the paper against the bottom and inside of the pan to fit snugly. Press and crease the paper edges down around the outside of the cake pan, too.
Gently take out both the removable bottom and the parchment sheets, which are now molded into the shape of the pan. Place the removable bottom back into the cake pan (as it should be). Then, fit the molded parchment paper back into the cake pan on top of the removable bottom. Press the paper down to fit snugly. (If you‘re doubling the recipe, repeat this process with a second cake pan.)
To Make the Batter
Place 1 lb cream cheese in a large bowl. Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature. If not, microwave the cold cream cheese at half power (50%) for 45 seconds, or microwave it in 15-second increments until it‘s at room temperature.
★ Hand Mixing Method
Press down on the cream cheese with a spatula to soften it. Then, add ½ cup sugar. (For the blender method, scroll down to the next section.)
Combine the cream cheese with the sugar by rubbing the mixture against the sides of the bowl with the spatula. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules dissolve.
Scrape both the bowl and spatula often to ensure that the ingredients are well incorporated and there are no lumps.
Crack 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) in another bowl and whisk well.
Slowly and gradually add the beaten eggs to the cream cheese mixture, one-third at a time. Make sure the batter is smooth and with no lumps before adding more egg.
After each addition, blend the eggs with the cream cheese THOROUGHLY and COMPLETELY.
Add the rest of the egg and blend well.
Scrape the batter from the sides of the bowl and spatula, making sure there are no lumps in the batter. Then, add 1 Tbsp lemon juice and mix thoroughly.
Next, add 2 Tbsp cake flour and 2 tsp cornstarch to a sieve. Holding the sieve in one hand, sift a little bit of the flour and cornstarch into the cream cheese mixture while you stir with a spatula. Incorporate the ingredients well before adding more. Keep sifting and blending until you‘ve added all the flour mixture. Take your time doing this. You don’t want any lumps.
Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and blend together. Make sure at this stage (before adding the heavy cream--more liquid) that there are no lumps.
Gradually add 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined.
★ Blender Method
Put all the ingredients for the cake batter in a blender (I use my Vitamix): 1 lb cream cheese, ½ cup sugar, 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 Tbsp cake flour, 2 tsp cornstarch, ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream. Blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Then, let this mixture rest for 15 minutes to let the air bubbles in the batter settle, or else the cake may crack.
To Pour the Batter into the Pan
Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so you don‘t create any air pockets. Tap the cake pan on the countertop a few times to eliminate air pockets.
With a bamboo skewer or toothpick, pop the air bubbles if there are any. Then, run the skewer through the batter to remove any bubbles. Since the cheesecake may overflow during baking, place the cake pan on a baking sheet, just in case. Mine never did, but I still use a baking sheet as it helps to transfer the cake pan to and from the oven.
To Bake
Transfer the baking sheet with the cake pan to the oven and bake at 450ºF (230ºC) for a convection oven or 475ºF (245ºC) for a conventional oven. Bake until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30–35 minutes (please keep an eye on your cheesecake because every oven is different). The top of my cheesecake starts becoming dark at the 30-minute mark, then gets dark brown within 5 minutes. If you love a “gooey“ or “oozy“ texture, then you may bake for less time than I suggested, but you must chill your cake well to firm it up before serving. NEVER extend the bake time and thus overcook the cake, even if the top hasn‘t turned dark. The filling will curdle and you can‘t fix it. If the top doesn‘t darken within 30–35 minutes, you will probably need to adjust the oven temperature (or oven rack or preheating time) the next time you make it.
To Cool
Take out the cake when the surface is a dark, burnt color. The cake should wobble when you gently shake the pan. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature, about 2–3 hours. Don’t put it on the countertop directly, and make sure the air can circulate under the cake pan. You can place it on top of your gas range burner grate, if it‘s not in use.
To Chill
You can serve the cake either chilled or at room temperature (which we like, too). For a chilled or firmer cheesecake, cover the cake in the pan with a tea towel (don‘t use plastic, as condensation may drip onto the cake), and place in the refrigerator for 4 hours.
To Serve
Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. If you have chilled the cake, let it stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before serving.

To Make the Dough
Combine 2 cups all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 2½ Tbsp matcha green tea powder in a large bowl.
Sift the flour and the matcha powder.
In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat ¾ cup unsalted butter until smooth and creamy. Tip: It’s important to soften the butter ahead of time. Leave the cold butter out on the counter for 1 hour or microwave it in 5-second increments until softened.
Add 1 pinch Diamond Crystal kosher salt and blend.
Add 130 g confectioners’ sugar (1 cup + 2 tsp) and beat well until soft and light. As you blend, stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl occasionally.
Add 2 large egg yolks and mix well until combined.
Gradually add the flour and matcha mixture and mix until just combined. Do not overmix.
Add ¼ cup good-quality white chocolate baking chips and mix until just incorporated.
To Chill the Dough
Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a cylinder about 1½ inches (4 cm) in diameter and 7 inches (18 cm) long.
Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Tip: You can place the logs on a bed of uncooked rice while chilling. It’ll keep the dough in a nice cylindrical shape so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side. To freeze for later: You can also freeze the unbaked logs of dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 months. To bake, let the frozen log sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before slicing and baking. Do not let the dough fully defrost.
To Slice and Bake
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking liner. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap the plastic wrap. Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into rounds about ⅓ inch (7 mm) thick. If the dough is too hard to slice, wait about 5 minutes before slicing. Place the sliced dough on the baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the rounds.
Bake the cookies at 350ºF (175ºC) for about 15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies get slightly golden brown.

Please note that this recipe requires 1 hour of resting time and 2 hours of chilling time.
Gather all the ingredients. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need. Please use cake flour only! Do NOT use flour with a high-gluten content such as bread flour or all-purpose/plain flour for this recipe. Otherwise, you will end up with a rubbery cake.
To Make the Crepe Batter
Add 1¾ cups whole milk and 3 Tbsp sugar to a small saucepan and combine well. Heat on medium until the milk is warm to the touch.
Beat 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) in a large bowl. Then, whisk the eggs continuously as you slowly and gradually add the warmed milk. Next, slowly add 1½ Tbsp unsalted butter to the egg mixture, whisking continuously.
Set up a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl. Add 1 cup cake flour, 2 Tbsp matcha (green tea powder), and ½ tsp baking powder to the sieve. Then, sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter. Use a whisk to combine the dry and wet ingredients together.
Sift the rest of dry ingredients and gently mix just until there are no lumps in the batter. IMPORTANT: Do not overmix; mixing increases gluten formation in the batter and causes a rubbery texture.
Next, set the fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the batter through the sieve. This will remove any lumps and give you a smooth batter texture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (DO NOT SKIP!) Tip: If you overmix the batter, you may want to rest the batter for a few hours. This allows the gluten to relax. If you don‘t rest it long enough, the crepes will be more rubbery due to gluten development.
To Cook the Crepes
Prepare a work surface with a sheet of parchment paper large enough to hold your cooked crepes. Now, make one large crepe for the top layer. First, set a 12-inch nonstick frying pan on low heat. Why low heat? We want to take time to thoroughly heat up the entire pan without a hot spot. Once the pan is hot throughout, brush the surface with a thin layer of neutral oil (I used an oil brush); remove any excess oil with a paper towel (don’t worry, a thin layer of oil will remain). Increase the pan to medium-low heat. Stir the batter with a ladle and pour just enough batter to cover the bottom of the frying pan in a thin layer. For my pan, this is about ⅓ cup (80 ml) of batter. Swirl the pan to distribute the batter and form a thin layer. Tip: If your first crepe seems too thick, thin the batter by gradually adding 1 Tbsp of milk.
Cook the crepe on medium-low heat for 2 minutes without touching it. After 2 minutes, the outside edge of the crepe will get a bit crispy. Using a chopstick, a spatula, or your hand, carefully flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer the crepe to the work surface lined with parchment paper.
To make the crepes for the cake layers, set a 10-inch nonstick frying pan on low heat. Again, take time to make sure the entire pan is hot. Once the pan is hot*, brush it with the oil and remove any excess with a paper towel. Increase the pan to medium-low heat. Pour just enough batter to cover the bottom of the frying pan in a thin layer, about ¼ cup (60 ml) for my pan. Swirl the pan to distribute the batter into a thin layer.* The hot pan helps to steam the liquid in the eggs and milk, allowing the crepe to puff up and become softer.
Cook the crepe on medium-low heat for 2 minutes without touching. After 2 minutes, the outside edge of the crepe will get a bit crispy. Using a chopstick, a spatula, or your hand, carefully flip the crepe.
Cook the other side for 30 seconds and transfer it to the work surface lined with parchment paper.
Continue making crepes until you‘ve used all the batter. Make sure to stir the batter EVERY TIME before you make a new crepe (otherwise, the batter will become too thick toward the end). With this batter, I made 1 large crepe for the top and 13 smaller crepes for the layers.
To Make the Whipped Cream
Prepare an ice bath by adding ice cubes and water to a larger bowl and setting a smaller bowl on top. Add 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream to the smaller bowl. Using a hand mixer, start whisking it at a low speed. Once you see bubbles form, slowly add 3 Tbsp sugar.
Increase the speed and whip the cream until firm peaks form. With medium peaks, the whipped mixture is firm and glossy. When you lift up your beaters, peaks will form but curl down slightly at the tips.
To Assemble the Cake
Prepare two long strips of parchment paper and lay them down in a cross pattern on a working surface or rotating cake stand (I used IKEA‘s lazy Susan). These strips will go under the cake and help you transfer it to a dish. Tip: You can watch how I assemble the cake in my video.
First, center the larger crepe on top of the crossed strips. This will be the top layer when we flip the cake over. Put a small amount of the freshly whipped cream in the center. Using an offset spatula, spread it evenly and thinly, about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick, in the center 8 inches of the crepe, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) border around the edge.
Next, center and place another crepe on top of the cream layer. Spread a small amount of whipped cream evenly in the middle of the crepe, leaving a ½-inch (1.3-cm) border around the edge.
Continue this process of layering, ending with the final crepe on top.
Prepare a round, curved shallow dish (mine is from IKEA) and line it with a piece of plastic wrap large enough to wrap around the entire cake. Remove any air pockets and smooth out the plastic on the dish‘s surface. Using the paper strips you made, transfer the mille crepe to the shallow dish. Place your cake in the middle of the dish and remove the strips from the bottom of the cake.
Starting at one corner and moving clockwise, pull the plastic wrap snugly over the cake edge so it‘s smooth and curved and gather the plastic in one hand above the center of the mille crepe. Continue to wrap this way until you‘ve gathered all the plastic in the center. This will make the final cake evenly round; you won‘t get a smooth, curved shape if you wrap it randomly. Secure the gathered plastic with a clip (I use one from IKEA). Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until the cake is set.
To Serve
Once chilled, unwrap the plastic wrap and flip the mille crepe over onto a serving platter. Now, the large crepe will be on top of the cake.
Dust 2 tsp matcha (green tea powder) over the cake using a fine-mesh sieve. If you plan to serve extra fresh whipped cream on the side (optional), make a second batch now. Slice your Matcha Mille Crepe Cake into wedges while chilled (as it‘s easier to cut), and let it stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.

Please note that this recipe requires a chilling time of 4 hours. Also, read the Notes section at the end of this recipe card for important tips to successfully make this Nama Chocolate.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Nama Chocolate
With a sharp knife, chop 14 oz good-quality dark chocolate (70% cacao) into smaller pieces so that they will melt faster and more evenly.
Line an 8- x 8-inch (20- x 20-cm) baking dish with parchment paper. Tip: To make the chocolate the correct height, it‘s important to choose a dish or tray that‘s the right size; if you use a bigger tray, the chocolate will be flatter.
Add 200 ml heavy (whipping) cream (¾ cup + 4 tsp) into a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the cream to ALMOST a boil. Whisk lightly to evenly distribute the heat. Keep an eye on the cream to make sure it doesn‘t boil. Tip: Overheating the cream may cause the chocolate to separate in the next step (see Notes below for more information).
When you see small bubbles form around the edges of the saucepan, remove it from the heat.
Next, add the chocolate pieces into the cream and stir with a silicone spatula to combine. Tip: Make sure your utensil is completely dry; introducing even a tiny amount of water or steam may cause the melted chocolate to seize (see Notes below for more details).
Mix until the chocolate is melted and there are no more lumps. The chocolate and cream mixture should be completely smooth.
If you‘d like, add 1 Tbsp liqueur of your choice (optional), and stir to incorporate.
Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the surface with the silicone spatula.
Tap the baking dish onto the counter a few times to make sure the chocolate is evenly distributed. Refrigerate until firm, about 4–5 hours.
To Cut the Chocolate
After chilling for 4–5 hours, remove the chocolate with its parchment paper from the baking dish. Peel away the parchment paper from the sides.
With a sharp knife, cut off the stray pieces of excess chocolate around the four sides to make sharp corners and edges.
Warm up the knife with a hot towel. Then, cut the chocolate slab into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips. Make sure to clean and warm the knife before each cut to achieve a nice sharp cut.
If your baking dish has curved edges and corners like mine, the edge strips may not be the ideal shape for cutting into neat chocolate cubes. If that‘s the case, cut off and save these chocolate pieces for yourself to enjoy.
Next, cut the strips into cubes. Remember to clean and warm up the knife before each cut.
Using a sugar duster or fine-mesh sieve, sprinkle the cubes on top with Dutch-process cocoa powder. Optionally, if you prefer the powder to completely cover the chocolate, you can dip each piece in the cocoa powder to coat all sides.
To Serve
Keep the Nama Chocolate refrigerated. Serve it on a plate, or put it in a box as a gift. I recommend letting the chilled and firm chocolate sit at room temperature for 5–10 minutes before serving so it‘s soft enough to melt in your mouth.

Gather all the ingredients. This recipe uses an 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pan. For a larger or smaller pan, see how to adjust the ingredient measurements in the blog post. Use a light-colored pan for the best outcome; see the baking tips section of my blog post for more details.
To Preheat the Oven
Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC).
To Line the Baking Pan
Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pan with parchment paper. Here, I use a pre-cut parchment paper sheet. To measure the pan’s bottom, place it on a sheet of parchment paper and trace around the outside with a pen. For the pan’s sides, use the extra paper next to the circle you traced. This paper should be a rectangle that‘s roughly 8 x 12½ inches (20 x 32 cm). Fold it in half lengthwise and make a sharp crease to mark the center line.
With a pair of scissors, cut out the circle you traced. I like to cut just inside the line so the circle is the right size. Set it aside. Next, cut off the rectangular sheet from the paper if it’s still attached, as I did here.
With the rectangular sheet folded in half lengthwise, fold up the long edges together to form a flap about ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide. Make a sharp crease to mark the flap, then unfold it. Holding the edges together, cut straight notches up to the crease mark every ½ inch (1.3 cm) across the entire length of the flaps.
Then, unfold the rectangular sheet and cut it in half along the center line crease. Now, you have two strips each with a notched flap along one long edge. Line the sides of the pan with the strips, flap sides down with the notches lying flat on the pan’s bottom. The folded part should fit neatly where the pan’s side meets the bottom. Overlap the short edges of the strips.
Finally, line the bottom of the pan with the parchment paper circle, placing it on top of the notched flaps.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Combine ¼ cup cake flour, ¾ cup Dutch-process cocoa powder, and ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and sift using a fine-mesh sieve.
It‘s important to sift as cocoa powder may have clumps (see photo). Press them down with a spoon so the cocoa passes through the mesh. Repeat sifting 2–3 times and set aside.
Wipe a stand mixer bowl (or a large mixing bowl) with a clean towel. This ensures that there is no moisture or grease in order to properly whip the egg whites. Separate 5 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), putting the whites in the mixer bowl and the yolks in a separate large bowl. Keep the egg whites at room temperature. If they are cold, the chocolate mixture may solidify.
Set up a double boiler by placing a heatproof glass bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water on the lowest heat. Cut 9 Tbsp unsalted butter into smaller chunks or cubes.
To Prepare the Chocolate Mixture
Add the butter and ¾ cup chocolate chips to the glass bowl. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted. Meanwhile, prepare the egg yolk mixture in the next step. Tip: Make sure not to introduce any moisture to the bowl; otherwise, the chocolate will seize.
To Prepare the Egg Yolk Mixture
Add ½ cup sugar to the egg yolks.
Beat the yolk mixture with a hand whisk until it becomes a thick texture and pale in color.
To Combine the Yolk and Chocolate Mixtures
The chocolate mixture should be 122ºF (50ºC). I recommend getting an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature (it‘s useful for steak, fish, and custard, too). Pick up the bowl from the double boiler and wipe off the moisture/steam on the bottom of the bowl. We do not want to drop any moisture into the batter while pouring the chocolate mixture.
Add the chocolate mixture to the yolk mixture, one-quarter portion at a time. Using a hand whisk, combine well before adding the next portion.
Continue adding the chocolate mixture, one-quarter portion at a time. Blend well after each addition so the mixture is homogeneous. Chocolate will solidify if the chocolate mixture is not warm enough or the yolk mixture is too cold. This is why it‘s important to use room-temperature eggs.
Microwave 2 Tbsp milk for 10 seconds incrementally, until it‘s steaming. Add it to the batter and whisk to combine. Tip: The milk will help warm up the batter, preventing the chocolate from hardening.
To Beat the Egg Whites
Working with the whisk attachment of the mixer, beat the room-temperature egg whites at Medium speed until they are foamy.
Start adding ½ cup sugar in 3 separate additions while beating.
Then, increase the speed to High and continue beating until very soft peaks form.
To test for very soft peaks, do the following: Remove the whisk attachment from the mixer. With the whisk attachment, hand mix the egg whites one more time, scraping from the bottom and lift it up. The egg whites should not be runny, yet soft enough that they drop a few times and stop. Do not overbeat the egg whites.
To Add the Egg Whites and Dry Ingredients
Add one-third of the whipped egg whites to the batter. With the whisk, stir the mixture with a scooping motion. Stop mixing when you see a nice marble effect (see next step) in the mixture.
Add the dry ingredients to the batter all at once.
Continue using a scooping motion with the whisk to combine the mixture until the majority of the dry ingredients are incorporated but a little bit of dry ingredients are still left.
Add the rest of the egg whites to the batter. Switch to a silicone spatula and gently fold in the egg whites, scraping the bottom of the bowl. It‘s important to fold the batter without deflating the air.
Continue to fold just until the color is uniform and no white streaks or dry ingredients remain. Do not overmix, but at the same time, you can‘t undermix as the cake may form a hollow spot inside.
Pour the batter into the pan all at once and in one spot to both minimize air pockets and smooth the top of the batter. Drop the pan onto the counter two times to bring up any air bubbles trapped in the batter.
To Bake
Bake the cake at 350ºF (175ºC) for 55–60 minutes until a toothpick pulls out moist crumbs (not wet batter) when inserted near the center of the cake. Tip: If you‘re using a dark-colored cake pan, your cake may bake faster than mine did. I recommend reducing the oven temperature by 25ºF (15ºC) and checking for doneness 10 minutes earlier, starting at about the 45-minute mark.
When the cake is done, remove it from the oven and firmly drop the cake pan on the countertop to allow the water vapors to escape. Place the pan on a cooling rack and let the cake cool completely in the pan. As the cake cools, it may deflate a bit. For the best flavor and texture, wrap the cake (still in the pan) well so the moisture doesn‘t escape, then store it in the refrigerator overnight.
To Unmold the Cake and Serve
About 15 minutes before serving the cake, take it out from the refrigerator. Run a knife along the edges of the cake. Then, carefully turn the cake over onto your hand and remove the pan.
Invert the cake again onto a cake plate or stand so it is right side up. Remove the parchment paper from the sides of the cake. Leave the parchment paper on the bottom in place.
To Decorate with Strawberries and Whipped Cream (option 1)
In a stand mixer, whip ⅔ cup heavy (whipping) cream (should be very cold) and 4 tsp sugar until medium peaks form. If you‘re hand-whisking, you can whip while cooling the bottom of the bowl with ice water.
Medium peaks mean when you lift the whisk, the cream will hold its shape, but the tip of the peak will fold back on itself. To decorate the cake, use a fine-mesh sieve to dust the top with a fine layer of confectioners’ sugar. Next, top the cake with whipped cream; you can either pipe it as you like or follow the easy method I show here. First, transfer the whipped cream to the center of the cake‘s top.
Spread a circle of whipped cream with an offset spatula to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the cake‘s edge.
Cut ½ lb strawberries in half lengthwise. Place the first layer of strawberries, cut side up and tips pointing outward, on the whipped cream to form a ring near the edge of the whipped cream circle. Then, place a second ring of strawberries, cut side down this time, inside the ring of the first strawberry layer. Tip: For a natural look, create some irregular patterns.
Put the third and final layer of strawberries around the center. Decorate with small fresh mint leaves on top and lightly dust the strawberries with confectioners’ sugar. Enjoy!
To Decorate with Raspberries (option 2)
Dust with confectioners’ sugar and decorate the cake with 10 raspberries.

To Mix the Batter
Break or chop up 3.5 oz white chocolate into smaller pieces and put them in a heatproof large metal or glass mixing bowl (make sure the bowl is moisture- and grease-free).
Cut 3 Tbsp unsalted butter into small cubes and add to the bowl with the white chocolate.
To set up a double boiler, bring 2 inches of water in a pot to a gentle simmer and then rest the bowl with your ingredients on the pot. You want it to fit snugly without touching the water. Melt the chopped white chocolate and butter in the double boiler.
With a silicone spatula, mix and let the chocolate and butter melt completely.
Carefully remove the bowl from the double boiler. Make sure the steam or water doesn‘t get into the chocolate mixture or the chocolate will seize up. Add 3 Tbsp matcha (green tea powder) and mix them all together completely with the spatula, making sure there are no lumps.
Gradually add ¼ cup whole milk as you stir. Mix it together well.
Separate the egg whites and yolks of 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell). Put the whites in a small bowl and the yolks in a large bowl. Refrigerate or freeze the bowl with the egg whites for 15 minutes until cold. (It‘s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). Tip: In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar.Next, add 3 Tbsp sugar to the bowl with the yolks.
Whisk the egg yolks and sugar vigorously with a hand whisk until the mixture is a creamy, pale yellow color.
Add the matcha chocolate mixture to the egg yolk mixture and mix the batter well.
Use a flour sifter or fine-mesh sieve to sift 3 Tbsp cake flour into the batter.
Gently whisk the cake batter until the flour is just incorporated. Do not overmix.
Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and mix it all together.
To Make the Meringue
Remove the egg whites from the refrigerator or freezer and add them to a clean, large bowl. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, start whipping the egg whites on medium-low speed (or Speed 4 on a KitchenAid stand mixer) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy.
Gradually add 3 Tbsp sugar to the bowl while beating. Then, increase the mixer speed to high (or Speed 10 on a stand mixer). Beat vigorously until stiff peaks form (see the next step for how to check). It takes about 2 minutes of beating at high speed to reach stiff peaks. Tip: When using a stand mixer, I usually pause beating when the egg whites are almost done. I take off the whisk attachment from the mixer and use it to hand-mix the looser egg whites near the bowl‘s edge into the stiffer whites near the center until it‘s all homogenous in texture. Then, put the whisk back on and continue beating.
To check for stiff peaks, pull up your beaters or whisk. The meringue in the bowl or on the beaters/whisk should be firm enough to hold a peak, pointing straight up (or maybe folding over a little bit just at the very tips). By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture, too. Tip: If you overbeat the meringue, it will become very stiff and grainy and won‘t incorporate into the batter at all.
To Fold In the Meringue
Using the spatula or a hand whisk, add one-third of the meringue into the batter. Mix well by hand until it‘s homogeneous.
Gently fold in another one-third of the meringue. Take care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Finally, add the remaining whites and repeat the folding motion until the foam is just incorporated. Take care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Once it's well combined and homogeneous, fold the batter one last time and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there is no chocolate accumulation. The final batter should fall in ribbons when you lift the spatula or whisk.
To Bake
Transfer the cake batter into the prepared cake pan. Smooth out the surface with the spatula.
Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 325ºF (160ºC) and bake for another 20 minutes. When the cake is done baking, the center will still wobble slightly. The inside of the cake will be soft and moist, so you can’t insert a skewer to check doneness. Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool completely, about 4 hours (otherwise, it‘ll be impossible to cut). If you‘d like, you can cover the cooled cake and keep it in the refrigerator overnight.
To Serve
Remove the cake from the refrigerator (if you‘ve chilled it) and slice the cake. I highly recommend warming the chilled cake slices in the microwave for 5 seconds. Dust 1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar on top, if you‘d like, and serve. The cake literally melts in your mouth!

Gather all the ingredients. I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need.
Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the baking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will also need a 20-cm (8-inch) chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size pan, read my chiffon cake post to adjust the ingredients as well as the blog post of this recipe for the cocoa amount. Please see my Notes at the end of this recipe for additional details on ingredients and techniques.
To Mix the Batter
In a bowl, combine ⅔ cup cake flour, 1¼ tsp baking powder, and ½ cup Dutch-process cocoa powder and mix well with a fork or whisk. Set aside these dry ingredients.
Separate 5 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into yolks and whites. Keep the egg whites in a stand mixer bowl and the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl.
Refrigerate or freeze the bowl with the egg whites for 15 minutes so both the bowl and egg whites are cold. (It’s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). Tip: In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar.
Now, start mixing the batter. First, beat the egg yolks with a hand whisk (or stand mixer).
Add half of the ⅔ cup granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until it’s a creamy pale yellow color.
Add ¼ cup neutral oil and beat with a whisk to combine.
Add 95 ml whole milk or water (⅓ cup + 1½ Tbsp) and 1 tsp vanilla extract and combine well.
Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift half of the dry ingredients into the bowl with the egg mixture. Using a hand whisk, mix well to combine.
Sift the rest of the dry ingredients into the bowl and whisk by hand until just combined; do not overmix. Make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Set aside while you beat the meringue.
To Make the Meringue
Take out the bowl of egg whites from the refrigerator or freezer. Set the bowl on the stand mixer with a whisk attachment (I used the KitchenAid Professional Series).
Start whipping the egg whites on medium speed (Speed 5) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy.
Gradually add the remaining half of the granulated sugar in small increments while whisking. Once you add all the sugar, increase to a higher speed (Speed 8) and beat vigorously until stiff peaks form (see the next step for how to check). Tip: I usually pause beating when the egg whites are almost done. Take off the whisk attachment from the mixer and use it to hand-mix the looser egg whites near the bowl‘s edge into the stiffer whites near the center until it‘s all homogenous in texture. Then, put the whisk back on and continue beating.
To check for stiff peaks, pull up your whisk. The egg whites in the bowl or on the whisk should be firm enough to hold a peak, pointing straight up (or maybe a little bit folding over just at the very tips). By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture, too. If you overbeat the meringue, it will become very stiff and grainy and won‘t incorporate into the batter at all.
To Fold In the Meringue
Using a hand whisk, take one-quarter of the meringue from the bowl and add it to the batter. Whisk well by hand to combine until homogenous.
Take one-third of the meringue left in the bowl and this time, gently fold it into the batter without deflating the air bubbles in the meringue and batter.
Take another third and repeat the gentle folding process.
Take the final third and gently fold it in. Make sure to thoroughly mix without deflating the air bubbles.
The final batter should fall in ribbons when you lift the whisk. The image to the left below shows you what the ribbon stage looks like. Lastly, switch to a spatula and fold the batter one last time, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there is no chocolate accumulation.
To Bake
Prepare an ungreased 20-cm (8-inch) chiffon cake pan. From 6–8 inch high, pour the batter into the pan at just one spot to prevent air bubbles from forming. While holding the removable base in place, gently tap the cake pan on the work surface to release any air pockets in the batter.
Run a wooden skewer through the batter to release any remaining air pockets. Put the cake pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 35–40 minutes (40 minutes for my oven).
To check that it‘s done baking, insert a wooden skewer into the middle of the cake. If the skewer comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed, it‘s done. Tip: If the top of the cake gets dark too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil to prevent burning. (The cake may be too close to the heat source.)
Remove the cake pan from the oven and gently drop the pan onto the work surface to shock the cake. This stops the cake from shrinking.
Prepare a bottle with a long neck, such as a glass wine bottle. Invert the center tube of the cake pan onto the bottle‘s neck and let the cake cool completely in its pan. Cooling the cake upside down helps it stretch downward and maintain its loft.
Once the cake is completely cool, run a long offset spatula around the outer edge of the pan and a small offset spatula around the inner tube. Tip: I used to use a knife, but the tip of the knife tends to poke the cake while moving around, so I switched to offset spatulas.
Gently take out the removable base and cake from the outer pan. Then, run the offset spatula along the bottom of the cake to release it from the base.
Invert the cake with the removable base onto a plate or cake stand. The cake will slide off the inner tube. Chiffon cake is served “upside down” with the flat bottom on top.
To Serve
Dust the top of the cake with 1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar and decorate with raspberries and mint leaves, if you‘d like. Slice and enjoy.
To Store
I strongly recommend consuming the cake sooner for the best freshness. However, you can keep the cake covered on a plate or stand at room temperature in a cooler place for 1–2 days.

To Make the Dough
Cut 120 g unsalted butter (½ cup + ½ Tbsp) into small cubes. Keep them refrigerated until ready to use (I cut it on parchment paper and wrap up the butter for easy transfer).
In a food processor, combine 1⅓ cups all-purpose flour (plain flour), 40 g almond meal (¼ cup + 4 tsp), 6 Tbsp sugar, and ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. If you don’t have a food processor, you can simply use a bowl to mix all the ingredients.
If you want a finer texture for your 5 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds, add them now to the food processor. If you prefer to keep them whole, add them later with the egg yolk.
Take out the butter from the refrigerator, add to the food processor, and mix together. If you use a regular bowl to mix, use a dough/pastry blender to combine the butter into the dry ingredients.
Lastly, add 1 large egg yolk.
If the food processor is small (like mine) and it doesn’t look like it’s mixed completely, take it out and mix well with a silicone spatula.
To Roll and Chill the Dough
Put the dough on your work surface. Form it into a ball and divide into 2 equal portions.
Roll each portion into a log approximately 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. For me, it’s easier to work the dough when it is wrapped in plastic wrap. While rolling, unwrap some parts of the plastic wrap, then roll again. Form a nice shape.
Wrap the logs tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, for at least 1 hour (you can put them in the freezer to speed up the process as well). Tip: You can place the dough logs on a bed of raw rice to prevent them from becoming flat on the bottom.
To Bake
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Remove the plastic wrap and cut the dough into discs about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. If you prefer thicker cookies, cut into discs about ½ inch (1.3 cm) for a total of 20 thick cookies.
Place them on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. If you are baking in batches, make sure to keep the second batch in the refrigerator to chill until it‘s time to bake.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

If the ½ cup unsalted butter is not at room temperature yet, cut it into smaller pieces so that it will soften faster. It’s important to soften the butter before we start.
To Prepare the Cherry Blossoms
Separate 1 oz salt-pickled cherry blossoms into two groups: 1) The good flowers for decorating the cookies; and 2) 1 Tbsp of the damaged flowers for blending into the cookie dough.
To remove the saltiness, soak the two groups of flowers in separate bowls of water for at least 30 minutes. Tip: Salt is used to preserve the sakura leaves and flowers, but it‘s too salty to consume them as is, so we always need to soak them in water to remove the excess salt.
After 30 minutes, squeeze out the water from the damaged flowers and pat them dry with a paper towel.
Then, mince the damaged flowers and set aside.
Next, prepare the good flowers. Remove them from the soaking water, one stem at a time. As you do so, dip the flower head in the soaking water a few times so the petals point upward and lie in the same direction. Place it on a paper towel. Repeat with the rest of the cherry blossoms. When you‘re done, cover the flowers with another sheet of paper towel and gently pat dry. Set aside.
To Mix the Dough
Sift 1 cup cake flour in a bowl and add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to the same bowl. Set aside.
In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the softened butter until smooth and creamy.
Add ½ cup confectioners’ sugar and blend until soft and light, occasionally scraping down the bowl as needed.
Add 1 large egg yolk and mix well until combined.
Add the minced cherry blossoms and blend well. Note: I‘ve revised this recipe (3/4/23) to add the cherry blossoms to the dough before adding the flour; the video and the step-by-step pictures reflect the previous version of the recipe.
Gradually add the sifted cake flour and salt to the bowl and stir until just blended. Tip: Do not overmix, or the dough will be tough.
To Form the Cookies
Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on your work surface. Shape it into a cylinder, about 1½ inches (4 cm) in diameter. Tip: If the dough is too soft and sticky to roll, wrap it with plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes. This will firm up the dough and allow you to roll it into a log shape.
Wrap the dough log in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 2 hours. Optional: You can place the dough on a bed of rice while chilling. It’ll help keep the dough in a nice cylindrical shape, so your cookie slices won’t be flat on one side.
After 2 hours, take out the dough log from the refrigerator and remove the plastic. Next, wrap the dough with a damp paper towel to wet its surface slightly. Of course, you can use the traditional method and brush egg wash on the dough, but the damp paper towel method works every time for me.
In a tray that fits the cookie dough, sprinkle the white sparkling sugar. Remove the damp paper towel and roll the dough log in the sparkling sugar so that it adheres.
With a sharp knife, slice the dough into rounds about ⅓ inch (7 mm) thick. You should get 16–18 cookie rounds from one log. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking liner. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the rounds.
Decorate the top of each cookie round with one or two reserved cherry blossoms, gently pressing them down so they adhere to the dough. Put the baking sheet with the cookies in the refrigerator for 10–15 minutes (or in the freezer for a short time) until firm and chilled. During this time, place the oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Tip: If you don‘t chill the cookie dough, the butter will melt too quickly in the oven and the cookie dough will spread and flatten.
To Bake
When the oven is preheated, take out the baking sheet from the refrigerator and bake the cookies at 350ºF (170ºC) for about 15 minutes, or until the edges turn golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes; then, carefully transfer them to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving.
To Store
You can keep the cookies in an airtight container and store in a cool place for at least 4 days. You can also freeze the unbaked logs of dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 months.

To Make the Dough
In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat ½ cup unsalted butter (at room temperature) for 30 seconds. Tip: To bring cold butter to room temperature, microwave a cold stick of butter for 5 seconds on each side for 20 seconds total.
Add ½ cup sugar and 2 Tbsp miso.
Beat everything together on medium-high speed until smooth, light, and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Crack 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) at room temperature and whisk in a small bowl. (If the egg is cold, soak it in warm water to bring to room temperature.) Gradually add the egg to the butter mixture while mixing.
Beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine in between.
In a small bowl, combine 1⅔ cups all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder and mix with a fork. I do this extra step so the baking powder is evenly distributed when sifting.
With a fine-mesh sieve, sift the flour mixture over a medium bowl.
Gradually add the flour mixture into the mixing bowl at low speed.
Once you finish adding all the flour mixture, turn up to high speed and beat until incorporated.
To Roll the Dough Logs
Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the working surface and transfer the dough. If the dough is very soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. By chilling, the butter/fat will solidify and it‘ll be easier to work with.
Roll the dough into a ball and cut it in 2 pieces. Note: This recipe can be used for cutout cookies: Form the dough into a disc, wrap and chill, roll out to ¼–½ inch thickness, cut, and bake.
Roll the dough into 2 long logs.
Each log should be 10 inches (25 cm) long with a 1-inch (2.5-cm) diameter.
Cut the long logs in half; now you have 4 logs that are each 5 inches (12.5 cm) long.
Prepare a small flat container (or baking sheet) and add 3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds (save the black ones for later). Moist a sheet of paper towel with water and wrap around a log so the dough is moistened.
Roll 2 moistened logs in the sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
I‘ve learned the best way to keep the dough from flattening out on the bottom is to place the dough logs on a bed of raw rice.
Roll the other 2 moistened logs in 3 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds and wrap in parchment paper or plastic.
To Slice and Bake the Cookies
Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tip: I highly encourage you to use an aluminum baking sheet and check your oven‘s temperature using an oven thermometer; see the Notes section below for more details.
Once the dough is chilled, use a sharp knife to cut one dough log into 8 slices of even thickness.
Cut the rest of the cookie dough and transfer to the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If the dough is no longer chilled, you can put the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until the cookies are chilled and firm. Tip: If the cookie dough is chilled, they will not completely lose their shape.
Bake the chilled cookies for 20–22 minutes or until lightly browned on the edges. Tip: Closely monitor the cookies in the oven and be ready to adjust the bake time if needed, especially if you‘re not using an aluminum baking sheet.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Add 1 Tbsp sake and 4 cups chicken stock/broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Taste your soup and add up to 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (if necessary) and ¼ tsp white pepper powder. Tip: Each brand of chicken stock varies in saltiness, so you must taste your soup to decide how much salt to add.
Your soup broth is now done. Cover with the lid and keep the soup broth simmering while you cook the noodles.
To Prepare the Ramen Noodles
Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil (ramen noodles already include salt in the dough). When the water is boiling, ladle some of the hot water into the individual ramen bowls to warm them up. Meanwhile, gently shake 2 servings fresh ramen noodles with your hand to separate and loosen them.
Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. I cook the noodles al dente so they're still firm, about 15 seconds less than the suggested cooking time. Before your noodles are done cooking, empty the hot water from the warmed ramen bowls.
When the noodles are done, quickly pick them up with a mesh sieve and shake out the excess water. Make sure to drain it well, as you don’t want the boiling water to dilute your soup. Serve the noodles into the warmed bowls.

Gather all the ingredients. A typical ramen bowl can hold 1200–1400 ml of liquid. We will prepare 1½ cups (360 ml) of soup broth per bowl, which should be more than enough. If you’re using bigger bowls, you may need to prepare extra soup.
Make sure all the toppings are ready to go before you begin cooking the ramen. If you‘re making my Ramen Eggs recipe (1 per bowl), prepare them a day in advance. I also like to divide and add ½ cup of my Spicy Bean Sprout Salad and ¼ cup of my friend Seonkyoung‘s homemade vegan kimchi. Finally, ¼ cup corn (frozen or canned) and 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed) are other popular toppings to divide among the bowls.
To Make the Vegan Dashi
Measure 1 cup water. Add 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) and 1–2 dried shiitake mushrooms. I set a small heavy cup or bowl on top to keep the mushrooms completely submerged in the water. Soak for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the ramen ingredients.
After 30 minutes, transfer this cold brew vegan dashi (the liquid, kombu, and shiitake) to a medium saucepan.
Slowly bring it to a near boil over low heat; this slow extraction will enhance the dashi flavor. Right before the liquid boils, remove the kombu and shiitake mushroom from the dashi. Turn off the heat. Tip: If you leave the kombu in the pot, the dashi will become slimy and bitter.
Transfer the vegan dashi to a measuring cup. Make sure you have 1 cup; if not, add water.
Tip: You can repurpose the spent kombu to make Simmered Kombu (Kombu Tsukudani) and Homemade Furikake (Rice Seasoning). Cut off the stem of the spent shiitake mushroom and use the cap just as you would a fresh shiitake mushroom.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Prepare a big pot of water for cooking the bok choy and noodles. Slowly bring it to a boil on medium-low heat while you prepare all the ingredients.
Grind and crush 2 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds in a Japanese mortar and pestle (suribachi and surikogi).
Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater). Reserve 1½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice). If you’re unsure how much ginger flavor you’d like, start with less and add more later.
Next, mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press).
Separate the green and white parts of 2 green onions/scallions. Cut the white part (for the soup broth) into thin rounds.
Then, cut the green part (for the garnish) into thin rounds. Keep them in separate bowls.
Cut 1 head Shanghai bok choy into quarters lengthwise and rinse clean under water. Debris tends to hide between the layers, so rinse them thoroughly.
To Make the Soup Broth
Set a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil, the minced garlic, the grated ginger, and the white part of the green onions/scallions. Cook until fragrant, about 1–2 minutes. Tip: Make sure not to burn the aromatics.
Add 1½ Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste) and 1½ Tbsp miso to the saucepan. Stir constantly so that they don’t burn. Tip: Try different miso types to create a slightly different flavor for the soup broth. For information on doubanjiang substitution, see the blog post.
Next, add 1 Tbsp sake and use a wooden spatula to stir and release the bits of the sauce attached to the bottom of the saucepan.
Add the ground sesame seeds and 1½ Tbsp soy sauce and mix it all together.
Gradually add 2 cups unsweetened soy milk, stirring constantly and making sure to dissolve the doubanjiang and miso.
Then, add 1 cup Vegan Dashi.
Taste the soup now and adjust the seasoning with ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and 1 dash of white pepper powder, to taste. Don‘t be shy about adding salt because the broth will taste less salty after you add the noodles. Turn off the heat, cover with a lid, and set aside.
To Blanch the Bok Choy
Prepare a medium bowl of cold water and set aside. In the big pot of boiling water, add the bok choy, stem end first, and cook it for 2 minutes. When the bottom end is tender, turn off the heat.
Without draining the water, remove the blanched boy choy from the pot and transfer it to the bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Keep the hot water in the big pot to cook the noodles in the next step. Once the bok choy is cool enough to handle, squeeze the water out and set aside.
To Reheat the Broth and Cook the Noodles
Now, it‘s time to reheat the soup broth until it‘s piping hot, but don‘t let it overboil because it may curdle. Before cooking the fresh noodles, loosen them up with your hands.
Turn the heat back on for the big pot of water and bring it to a boil again. Once boiling, add 2 servings fresh ramen noodles and cook according to the package instructions. While cooking, stir and separate the noodles with chopsticks. Here, I cook the noodles inside a big noodle strainer (I got it in Japan) that I’ve set inside the pot.
When the noodles are done cooking, drain them well in a strainer, shaking it a few times to drain the water thoroughly (otherwise it will dilute the soup broth). Transfer the noodles to the individual ramen bowls.
To Serve
Divide and pour the piping-hot soup broth with seasonings over the noodles. Then, divide and add the bok choy and toppings of your choice to the bowls. I topped this Vegetarian Ramen with 2 ramen eggs sliced lengthwise, ¼ cup frozen or canned corn, 1 sheet nori (dried laver seaweed), ½ cup Spicy Bean Sprout Salad, and ¼ cup vegan kimchi.

Before You Start: Please note that this rolled Chashu recipe requires an overnight resting time of 8 hours.
DAY 1
Gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Pork Belly
Roll up your 1 block of pork belly (2–2½ lb or 907–1134 g). Make sure one or both ends have a “bacon-like“ appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the rind, remove it or ask your butcher to do it for you.
Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the rolled end tightly. Make sure you leave a tail of about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of twine at the end.
Next, tightly wrap the twine around the spot you just tied another 2 or 3 times to secure the starting point of the roll. Then, pull the twine to the opposite end of the pork belly roll. Tightly wrap the twine around that end 2 to 3 times to secure it.
Next, start wrapping the twine around the roll back toward the starting point. Space each wrap ⅓ inch (1 cm) apart. Make sure you wrap the roll as tightly as possible.
Once you reach the starting point, run the twine under some of the end wraps; this hooks the twine in place so you can reverse direction. Next, run the twine under 4 or 5 wraps going away from the starting point. Then, double back toward the starting point, running your twine under the wraps until you reach the original double knot.
Find the 3-inch tail of twine that you left when you started. Tie a double knot with the tail and the long end of the twine, and cut the excess.
To Cut the Aromatics
Cut the green part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) and set aside; reserve the white part for another use. Cut 4 slices ginger (unpeeled).
To Sear the Pork Belly
Heat 1 Tbsp neutral oil in a cast-iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. Add the tied pork belly to the skillet.
Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating it to make sure all sides are golden brown.
It’ll take about 10–15 minutes all together.
To Prepare the Braising Liquid
While the pork is searing, prepare the braising liquid. Put 1 cup sake, 1 cup soy sauce, 2 cups water, and ⅔ cup sugar in a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) that will fit the chashu. Then, add the Tokyo negi (green part) and 4 slices ginger.
To Simmer the Chashu
Transfer the seared chashu roll to the Dutch oven.
Bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat.
Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredients down and limit the evaporation. You do not need to use a regular lid to control the evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make one with aluminum foil (here’s how to make the otoshibuta).
Simmer on low heat, and cover with the otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, turning the chashu every 30 minutes.
After 2 hours, the braising liquid has reduced a bit. Turn off the heat to let the chashu roll cool a little bit.
To Rest the Chashu Overnight
Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer it to a container or a plastic food vacuum-sealing bag, such as one for the FoodSaver system. (If you‘re doubling or tripling this recipe, put each chashu roll in its own bag.) Strain the leftover cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer.
Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag. If using a container, add about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the braising liquid to the bottom and cover.
If using the FoodSaver bag, seal it with a FoodSaver sealer. Tip: Fold a piece of paper towel to plug the entry of the FoodSaver bag. This paper towel will absorb any extra moisture when you seal.
Tip: I also made quick Ramen Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago) with the leftover liquid. Simply cook and peel soft-boiled eggs, add them to a bag with ½ cup of the cooking liquid, and close. Cover the cooking liquid, and store the chashu, ramen eggs, and the cooking liquid in the refrigerator.
DAY 2
Open the bag of chashu.
Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove the twine pieces completely.
Slice the chashu into ¼-inch pieces and keep the end piece for Chashu Fried Rice!
Place the chashu slices on a ceramic plate. Sear and enhance the flavor with a kitchen butane torch. You can also use a broiler in the oven. Enjoy them immediately or serve on your ramen.
Scoop up and discard the solidified fat from the cooking sauce.
Strain the sauce over a fine-mesh sieve to make sure the solidified fat is left behind. Pour the sauce into a mason jar or container and seal. The sauce will last for a month in the refrigerator. I use it for drizzling over the chashu and for making stir-fried dishes, marinades, and ramen eggs.
To Store
You can store the chashu in the refrigerator for up to 7 days or 1 month in the freezer. I usually divide the rolled chashu into thirds and freeze 2 portions separately (for ramen right away, and Chashu Fried Rice and Chashu Bowl for later). Ramen Eggs should be consumed in 3–4 days if they are soft-boiled eggs and 7 days if hard-boiled eggs. The eggs get saltier the longer you keep them in the marinade, so remove them from the sauce when they have the right taste.
FOR NON-ROLLED CHASHU
Gather all the ingredients. For small blocks of pork belly (about 1 lb) like I‘ve used here, you don’t need to roll them up before cooking, and the simmering time is just 1 hour (instead of 2 hours). Tip: To cook 1 lb (454 g) of pork belly, see the ingredients list in the Notes section at the end of the recipe card.
Heat a cast iron skillet (or regular frying pan) over high heat. When the pan is hot, add ½ Tbsp neutral oil. Sear ¾ lb pork belly block fat-side down first, then flip over to sear the other side; this will take about 10 minutes.
While searing, prepare a heavy-bottomed pot (or regular pot) that will fit the chashu. To the pot, add the green part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion), 4 slices ginger (unpeeled), ⅓ cup sake, ⅓ cup soy sauce, ⅔ cup water, and 3 Tbsp sugar. Once you‘re done searing the meat, add it to the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil, skimming the scum and foam. Then, turn the heat to low/simmer.
Put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredients down and limit the evaporation. If you don’t have an otoshibuta, you can make one with aluminum foil (here’s how to make otoshibuta). Simmer on low heat for 1 hour, turning the chashu every 15 minutes and keeping an otoshibuta on at all times.
After 1 hour, there is ½ inch of liquid left in the pot. Now, you have 2 options. Option 1: If you’re serving it right away, remove the otoshibuta and further reduce the sauce on low heat until the sauce thickens and you can see the bottom of the pot when you draw a line through the sauce with a spatula. Option 2 (recommended): Transfer the chashu to a container or bag with a little bit of cooking sauce and refrigerate overnight. Strain the leftover cooking sauce, transfer to a jar, and refrigerate.
To serve, slice the chashu into ¼-inch (6 mm) pieces. Sear and enhance the flavor with a kitchen butane torch. If you stored the chashu overnight and don’t want to sear the chashu, you can reheat it by soaking it in hot cooking sauce.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,False,
Ramen Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago),"['4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) (refrigerated; use slightly older eggs, which are easier to peel)', '¼ cup soy sauce', '¼ cup mirin', '¼ cup sake (or water)', '1 tsp sugar']","[{""ingredient"": ""eggs"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""soy sauce"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""mirin"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""sake"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""sugar"", ""heat_processed"": true}]","Before You Start: Please note that this recipe requires a marination time of 8 hours or overnight. Now, gather all the ingredients.
To Make the Marinade
Combine ¼ cup soy sauce, ¼ cup mirin, ¼ cup sake, and 1 tsp sugar in a small saucepan.
Bring it to a boil, whisking it to dissolve the sugar completely. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Set aside to cool completely.
To Cook the Soft-Boiled Eggs
Add 4 cups (1L) water to a medium saucepan or enough water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Bring the water to a full boil. Then, remove 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) from the refrigerator. Carefully and gently lower one egg at a time into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or a ladle. When you add the first egg, set a timer for 7 minutes. Optionally, you can cook them 6–6½ minutes for a runny egg yolk and 8–9 minutes for a custard-like egg yolk.
Once all the eggs are in the saucepan, lower the heat to maintain a gentle boil. Keep the water simmering but not bubbling so strong that the eggs bounce around. During the first 3 minutes, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while if you want to keep the egg yolks centered.
After 7 minutes, immediately remove the eggs and shock them in a bowl of iced water to cool for 15 minutes.
To Marinate the Eggs
Once the eggs are completely cool, gently crack the shell at the wide bottom end of the egg and start peeling it vertically toward the pointy top. Dip the egg in the iced water a few times to help with the peeling. Once you peel one section vertically, the rest of the shell comes off easily.
Place the peeled eggs and marinade in a plastic bag. Why do I recommend a plastic bag? It allows us to use less marinade to keep the eggs submerged. We use this marinade only once for food safety reasons, so it’s most economical to prepare no more than what you need. If you use a container instead of a bag, it requires more marinade to submerge the eggs.
Remove the air from the bag and use a clip or rubber band to seal it right above the eggs to keep them completely covered in marinade. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. You can rotate the eggs occasionally if you like.
To Serve
Remove the eggs from the marinade and cut them in half lengthwise. You can use a piece of string, fishing line, or cheese cutter (that‘s what I used here) to cut the eggs in half cleanly. Enjoy these Ramen Eggs in bento, as a ramen topping, or as a snack sliced in half and sprinkled with furikake (rice seasonings) and shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice). If you want to warm them, soak the bag in warm water to bring up the temperature faster.
To Store
Keep them refrigerated at all times and do not freeze as their texture changes when frozen. They will get saltier the longer they marinate, so take remove them from the marinade after 12–24 hours (depending on your preference). Enjoy the ramen eggs within 3–4 days if your eggs are soft-boiled. If your eggs are hard-boiled, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week. For food safety reasons, I do not recommend reusing this marinade with new boiled eggs. You can repurpose this marinade as a seasoning sauce for your stir-fried or simmered dishes, but use it soon.",en,True,"[""Japanese"", ""Chinese"", ""Fusion""]",False,False,

Please note that this recipe includes a chilling time of at least one hour or up to overnight.
Gather all the ingredients.
To Prepare the Fruit
Use a small (paring) knife to remove the core of 12 strawberries.
Use the knife to cut off both ends of 2 kiwis and peel the skin.
Use a knife to cut off both ends of 1 navel orange. Peel the orange by hand and separate the orange segments. Using your fingers, carefully peel back and remove the membrane from the sides of each segment (leave the membrane on the outer edge in place). Continue with all the orange segments. Tip: Using your fingers to segment the slices keeps the pulp is intact and minimizes the juice.
Set the prepared fruit on a tray or plate. Using a paper towel, pat the fruit dry to remove any excess moisture.
To Make the Whipped Cream
Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl about half full with iced water. Then, set a medium bowl on top of the iced water in the larger bowl. Make sure the medium bowl is clean and dry. Next, add 1 cup heavy (whipping) cream to the medium bowl and whisk on low speed using an electric hand mixer.
Once bubbly, add 5 tsp sugar and 1 tsp rum (optional) and whisk on medium-high speed.
The cream will thicken as you whisk.
When you lift the whisk out of the cream and it shows peaks, remove the bowl from the ice bath and switch to a hand whisk. Whisk until you achieve the right consistency and check as you go. Aim for medium peaks where the cream holds its shape when you lift the whisk, but the peak’s tip folds back on itself. The cream should be spreadable but not runny because it goes between the sandwich bread.
To Assemble the Sando
Line up 4 slices shokupan (Japanese milk bread) on your work surface. Next, add a dollop of whipped cream to each bread slice and spread it evenly. Reserve some whipped cream for later to fill in the gaps after you add the fruit. Tip: I prefer to keep the crust on the bread until the end. When you put your fruit between the two slices of the bread, the crust helps the sandwiches keep their shape.
Add the fruit next, placing it on only one slice of bread per sandwich. Think carefully how you want the cross section to look when you cut your sando in half, and align some of the fruit attractively along the cut line. I plan to cut the sandwiches diagonally into triangles, so I lined up my strawberries along the center diagonal to show their lengthwise cross section once sliced. For the kiwis and oranges, I chose a crosswise cross section. Tip: To keep track of your cut line, I recommend that you take a photo of your fruit's alignment and don‘t change the orientation of your sandwiches when you move them.
Add more whipped cream to fill in any gaps between the fruit. You don‘t have to use all the whipped cream. Tip: If you have leftover whipped cream, you can dip fruit in it or make Fruit Parfait.
For each sandwich, put the top slice of sandwich bread on the fruit with the whipped cream side down.
Prepare sheets of plastic wrap large enough to encase each sandwich. Wrap each sandwich tightly on all four sides. Remember, don’t change the orientation of the sandwiches as you wrap them.
With a marker pen, draw a line on the plastic wrap of each sandwich to mark your cut line with the attractive cross section.
Put the sandwiches between plates to gently compress them. Refrigerate them for at least one hour (and up to overnight). In Japan, putting weight on a sandwich prior to cutting them in half is a standard method.
To Slice
Remove the sandwiches from the refrigerator. Unwrap one sandwich and slice it in half along the marked cut line with a clean knife. Keep the sandwich halves closed (don’t open it up to show cross section yet). Clean the knife with a hot wet towel and repeat with the other sandwich.
Gently hold down each sandwich and cut off the crusts, cleaning the knife with a hot wet towel between cuts. Tip: Don‘t throw away the crusts; repurpose them to make Shokupan Crust Rusks. These crunchy, buttery snacks are so delicious! You can make them now or freeze those crust strips to make them later.
Now, you can reveal the cross section for the first time!
To Serve
Serve immediately. If you plan to transfer the sandwich, make sure to keep it chilled all times.

Before You Start: Please note that Japanese short-grain white rice requires a soaking time of 20–30 minutes. The rice-to-water ratio is 1 to 1.1 (or 1.2) for short-grain white rice. The ratio for brown rice is different; to learn more, read how to cook short-grain brown rice in a rice cooker or Instant Pot.
How to Measure: Overfill a plastic rice cooker cup (or use a ¾-cup measure) with uncooked short-grain rice and level it off. Put the rice in a large bowl. Repeat until you have the measured amount of rice needed. For this recipe, I measured 2¼ cups (3 rice cooker cups) of short-grain white rice. Tip: Without leveling it off, your rice will not have enough water to cook properly.
To Wash the Rice
Quick Rinse: Add just enough tap water to the bowl to submerge the rice. Then, discard the water immediately. Tip: Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so this quick rinse helps remove impurities from the rice and prevent it from absorbing the first few rounds of milky water.
Wash: Next, use your fingers to gently agitate the wet rice grains in a circular motion for 10–15 seconds. Don‘t use a strainer as it can break the rice. Tip: Using very little water allows the grains to rub against each other. It also reduces the absorption of impurities from the milky water.
Rinse: Add tap water and immediately discard the cloudy water. Repeat one more time.
Repeat the Wash and Rinse process (steps 2 and 3) one to two more times.
Drain: When the water is almost clear, drain the rice completely.
Use a fine-mesh sieve to drain and shake off any excess water. Do not leave it for more than 5 minutes as it can easily get too dry.
To Soak the Rice
Put the well-drained rice and measured water in a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid(I use a 2.75-QT Staub here). For example, if you‘re cooking 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice (3 rice cooker cups), add 2½ cups water (600 ml). Soak the rice for 20–30 minutes before cooking.
To Cook the Rice
Cover the pot with a lid slightly ajar and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Take a quick peek to see if the water is boiling.
Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to low and cook, tightly covered, for 12–13 minutes.
When it‘s done cooking, open the lid and take a quick peek to check if the water is completely absorbed. If there‘s water left, close the lid and cook for a little longer.
To Steam the Rice
Remove from the stove and let it steam with the lid on for another 10 minutes. Tip: This resting period is crucial for the rice to steam properly.

Sometimes life happens and you just don‘t have 20 minutes to make dashi from scratch. On those occasions, you can use a Dashi Packet or Dashi Powder.
Gather all the ingredients. Most Japanese recipes would say to gently clean the kombu with a damp cloth. However, these days, kombu is quite clean, so just make sure it doesn't have any mold spots and it‘s ready to use. Do not wash or wipe off the white powdery substance, as it has lots of umami.
Make several slits in 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) to release more flavor.
To Make the Cold Brew Kombu Dashi Ahead of Time (Optional)
Put 4 cups water and the kombu in a large bottle and let it steep on the counter for 2–3 hours in the summertime and 4–5 hours in the wintertime. You can also cold brew the kombu dashi overnight in the refrigerator.
To Make the Awase Dashi
Add the kombu and water to a medium saucepan. If you have cold brew Kombu Dashi (previous step), add the Kombu Dashi and hydrated kombu to the saucepan.
Turn on the heat to medium low and slowly bring to almost boiling, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, clean the dashi by skimming the foam and debris from the surface.
Just before the dashi starts boiling gently, remove the kombu from the saucepan (discard or repurpose in other recipes—suggestions follow). If you leave the kombu in the saucepan, the dashi will become slimy and bitter.
Add 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) and bring it back to a boil again.
Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat, simmer for just 30 seconds, and turn off the heat.
Let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes.
Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl or measuring cup. Reserve the katsuobushi and repurpose it; see the suggested recipes that follow. The Awase Dashi is ready to use.
To Store
If you are not using the dashi right away, store the dashi in a bottle or mason jar and keep it in the refrigerator for 3–5 days or in the freezer for 2 weeks.
What to do with the spent katsuobushi and kombu?
Save the spent kombu and katsuobushi in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for up to a month.
With the spent kombu, you can make Simmered Kombu (Kombu Tsukudani).
You can also make Homemade Furikake (Rice Seasoning).
Optional: Niban (Second) Dashi
In a medium saucepan, put 2–4 cups* of water and previously used kombu and katsuobushi from making the first dashi. Bring it to a boil over medium-low heat. *2 cups would make a stronger dashi.
Remove the kombu just before the liquid comes to a boil, then lower the heat, and cook for 10 minutes, skimming occasionally.

Gather all the ingredients. Most Japanese recipes recommend gently cleaning the kombu with a damp cloth. However, kombu is pretty clean these days. Just make sure to dust off and remove mold spots, if any. Do not wash or wipe off the white powdery substance as it has lots of umami. For the dried shiitake mushrooms, check if there is any dust or dirt trapped in its gills under the caps. If there is, use a pastry brush to clean it off. Do not wash it under water.
To Cold Brew the Vegan Dashi (Mizudashi)
Put 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) and 2 pieces dried shiitake mushrooms in a large bottle. Then, add 4 cups water.
Put the cap on and let it soak on the counter for at least 30 minutes to extract the kombu’s flavor naturally. If possible, let it soak for 2–3 hours in the summertime and 4–5 hours in the wintertime. You can also cold brew it overnight in the refrigerator. After soaking, it‘s now ready to use as a cold brew Vegan Dashi. You can either remove the kombu and shiitake from the bottle now, or go to the next step to extract even more flavor. See my suggestions at the end of the recipe for how to repurpose the spent kombu and shiitake.
To Extract More Flavor from the Cold Brew Vegan Dashi
Transfer the cold brew Vegan Dashi, along with the kombu and shiitake, to a medium pot. Turn on the heat to medium low and slowly bring it to a bare simmer, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clean the dashi by skimming the foam from the surface with a fine-mesh skimmer.
Just before the dashi starts boiling, remove the kombu and shiitake from the pot. Then, turn off the heat. Tip: If you leave the kombu in the pot, the dashi will become slimy and bitter.

Joshinko (上新粉) is flour made with Japanese short-grain rice and shiratamako (白玉粉) is flour made with short-grain glutinous rice; they are different from other Asian varieties. For more details, see Notes at the end of the recipe card. Joshinko and shiratamako are pictured on the left and dangoko (団子粉) is pictured on the right. Whichever you decide to use, the instructions below are the same.
Gather the ingredients for the sweet soy glaze. Soak the bamboo skewers in water. You can start boiling a large pot of water on low heat (see Step 8).
To Make the Rice Dumplings
Combine ⅔ cup joshinko (Japanese rice flour) and ¾ cup shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) in a bowl. Using chopsticks, mix it all together until well blended. (If you‘re making the dumplings using dangoko, add 1⅓ cup dangoko (Japanese rice dumpling flour) instead to a bowl.)
Stir in some of the ⅔ cup boiling water, a little bit at a time, while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: You can always add more water so go with a small addition. The dough should be on the dry side.(Or, stir in some of the ⅔ cup water (cold) for the dangoko, a little bit at a time.)
When the flours start to stick together and eventually form clumps, stop adding water. Using your hands, combine the dough into one ball.
Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an “earlobe“ (that’s how we describe the tenderness of this type of mochi in Japanese).
Form the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
Then divide each piece into 2 smaller pieces. You will have 16 equal-sized pieces of dough. I always like to weigh mine. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.
Shape each of the dough pieces into a smooth, round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkles, dip the tip of your finger in water and apply a small amount of water to the cracked area to smooth it out. You now have 16 equal-sized dumplings.
Just before cooking the dumplings, prepare a bowl of iced water. Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop each dumpling into the pot with a smooth, continuous arm motion to avoid splashing. Cook them all at once. Stir the balls occasionally so they keep their round shape and don‘t stick to the bottom of the pot.
The dumplings will stay near the bottom of the pot at first, but they will float once cooked. When they rise to the top, boil them for an additional 1–2 minutes.
Transfer the dumplings to the bowl of iced water.
Once the dumplings have cooled, drain them well and transfer them to a tray. Tip: Wet the tray so the dumplings don‘t stick.
Skewer three pieces onto a bamboo skewer. Continue with the rest of the dumplings and set aside.
To Make the Sweet Soy Glaze
In a cold saucepan, add 4 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, ⅔ cup water, and 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch. Do not turn on the heat yet.
Mix all the ingredients together well until smooth. The potato starch/cornstarch will become lumpy if you heat the sauce without stirring beforehand. Now, turn on the heat and continue to whisk.
Keep whisking continuously, as the mixture can thicken suddenly.
When the sauce thickens, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. If you are making it ahead of time, remove the sauce from the heat before the consistency gets too thick. The moisture will continue to evaporate as it cools and thicken the sauce.
To Serve
Optional: Sear and enhance the flavor with a kitchen butane torch. You can also grill them over direct heat (if you are going to place them on a wire rack, grease it first, as the dumplings tend to stick). You can use a broiler to char the dumplings or use a nonstick frying pan to pan-fry the surface of the dango.
Pour the sweet soy glaze on top of the Mitarashi Dango and serve immediately.
To Store
Option 1: After you form the dough into round dumplings, you can store the uncooked dumplings in a single layer in an airtight container and freeze up to a month. When ready to use, boil the frozen dango without defrosting first.
Option 2: After boiling and cooling the dumplings, pat them dry and pack them so they don‘t touch each other into an airtight container. Freeze up to a month. When ready to use, microwave or boil them until warm.",en,True,"[""Japanese"", ""Chinese"", ""Indigenous""]",True,True,

To Make the Mochi Mixture
Combine ¾ cup shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) and ¼ cup sugar in a medium bowl and whisk it all together. Tip: If you can‘t find shiratamako, you can substitute ¾ cup mochiko (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour).
Add ¾ cup water and mix well until combined.
Microwave Method: If you’re using a microwave to cook the mochi, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on high (1100w) for 1 minute. Take it out and stir it with wet rubber spatula. Cover again loosely and cook for 1 additional minute. Stir again, cover loosely, and cook for 30 seconds more to finish cooking. The color of the mochi will change from white to almost translucent.
Steaming Method: If you’re using a steamer, wrap the steamer lid with a towel so the condensation does not drop into the mochi mixture. Put the bowl into the steamer basket and cover to cook for 15 minutes. Halfway through cooking, stir it with a wet rubber spatula, then cover to finish cooking. The color of the mochi will change from white to almost translucent.
To Roll and Cut the Mochi
Cover your work surface with parchment paper and dust it generously with some of the ½ cup potato starch or cornstarch. Then transfer the hot mochi on top.
To prevent it from sticking, sprinkle more potato starch on top of the mochi. Once it cools a bit, spread the mochi into a thin layer, about 3/16 inch (4–5 mm), with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch to your hands and the rolling pin as needed. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out the mochi.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes (no more than that) until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut 7–8 mochi wrapper circles with a 3½-inch (9-cm) cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch from these wrappers with a pastry brush. If you find any sticky spots, cover the area with potato starch, then dust it off. Next, stack the wrappers: Place a piece of plastic wrap on a plate and put a mochi circle on top. Then, layer another piece of plastic wrap on top, and add another wrapper. Repeat for all the wrappers. Roll the leftover mochi dough into a ball, roll it out into a thin layer, and cut out more wrappers circles. You can make about 12 mochi wrappers.
To Make the Daifuku
Now, we’re ready to make the Daifuku. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi wrapper on top. Using a medium cookie scoop, place one scoop of the 1½ cup sweet red bean paste (anko) on top of the mochi wrapper.
Pinch the four opposite points of the mochi circle together to enclose the anko. Then pinch the remaining edges together.
Put some potato starch on the sealed area and set aside, seam side down. Continue making the rest of the Daifuku.
To Store
Keep the Daifuku mochi in an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place. Enjoy within 2 days.

Please note that this recipe requires a chilling time of 12 hours or overnight.I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the Metric button above. If you‘re using a cup measure, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need.
Gather all the ingredients. The eggs must be at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). *Please see my latest update in the Notes below regarding the oven temperature. For a convection oven, reduce the oven temperature by 25ºF (15ºC) to 325ºF (165ºC). Prepare a spray bottle with water, an offset spatula, and a bamboo skewer. Use a 1 lb baking pan that is light-colored for the best outcome.
To Line the Baking Pan
On your work surface, place a sheet of parchment paper that‘s 13 x 16 inches (30 x 40 cm). Set a 1 lb loaf pan on top (I use a light-colored 1 lb loaf pan that‘s 8½ x 4½ x 2¾ inches or 22 x 11 x 7 cm). Mark the four corners of the loaf pan on the paper. Fold and crease the paper on all four sides following the corner marks.
Unfold the paper so that the long side of the creased rectangle is in front of you. On the two crease lines pointing toward you, cut slits up to the rectangle‘s left and right corners. Rotate the paper and cut two slits on the opposite long side. You will have four slits total. Then, place the paper in the baking pan, folding and layering the flaps to fit.
Cut a slit in each of the corner flaps down to the top edge of the pan. Then, fold down the paper over the pan‘s edges.
Secure the folded paper onto the edges with stainless steel clips to keep the lining from moving when you mix the batter during baking.
To Prepare the Ingredients
Combine 2 Tbsp water and 3 Tbsp honey in a small bowl. Then, add 1 Tbsp mizuame syrup (glutinous starch syrup). It‘s super sticky and extremely thick, so use a mini spatula to scrape it from the measuring spoon.
Take your time to dissolve the mizuame. Press down and mash the mizuame with the mini spatula to facilitate dissolving. Do not microwave the mixture as we do not want to increase the temperature of the batter. Set aside.
Sift 100 g bread flour with either a sifter or fine-meshed strainer. Hold the strainer‘s handle with one hand as you gently tap the strainer with the other, and the flour will gradually sift through. Tip: Why bread flour? That's what's traditionally used, and it gives the cake an elastic, bouncy texture that you cannot achieve with all-purpose flour.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, crack 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) that are at room temperature. Add 100 g sugar.
To Mix the Batter
Fit a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and vigorously beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (Speed 8/10) for 3–5 minutes without stopping. If you beat the eggs with a handheld mixer, it will take more time.
The beaten eggs will quadruple in volume and have a thick texture and pale yellow color.
When you stop the mixer and lift the whisk attachment, the mixture should fall in ribbons.
Gradually add the honey mixture to the batter while whisking on low speed (Speed 2) until combined, about 30 seconds.
Gradually add the bread flour while whisking on low speed (Stir) until just combined, for about 30 seconds. Do not overmix.
When the flour is just combined, stop whisking. When you lift the whisk, the batter should fall in ribbons.
Using a silicone spatula, scrape the batter from the bowl‘s sides and bottom and gently fold the batter a few times. Next, sprinkle ½ Tbsp white sparkling sugar on the bottom of the lined pan. This sugar will add a crunchy texture to the cake‘s bottom and help retain moisture.
Pour the batter into the cake pan in just one spot. This helps to minimize air pockets and smooth the top of the batter. Tip: If your pan is smaller than mine, you‘ll need to add the excess batter to another smaller pan and use a shorter bake time.
To level the batter and help remove air pockets, hold the cake pan 2 inches above the counter and drop it flat onto the counter. Then, draw a zigzag line through the batter with a bamboo skewer to further eliminate air bubbles.
To Bake
Place the cake pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven at 350ºF (180ºC). Close the oven door and set a timer for 2 minutes.
After the 2-minute timer beeps, reset the timer to 1 minute and complete the following several steps within the next minute (Ideally, within 30–40 seconds, so you can close the oven door ASAP). First, open the oven and spray twice above the cake batter with the spray bottle.
Next, use an offset spatula to quickly mix and circulate the batter 15 times from the left side, without touching the sparkling sugar at the bottom of the pan. This mixing technique, called awakiri (泡切り, “bubble cut“) in Japanese, helps to remove air pockets and even out the batter‘s temperature so the cake rises evenly without cracking.
Finally, quickly mix and circulate the batter 15 times from the right side. Shake off the excess batter from the spatula and close the oven door. Reset the timer to 2 minutes. Repeat this process (Step 2 to Step 4) 3 more times.
On the 4th and final time, after you finish the mixing process, remove the stainless steel clips. Run the bamboo skewer through the batter. If any of the clips were submerged in the batter, fill in the clip marks in the batter with the skewer.
Spray water into the oven, then continue to bake for another 30–40 minutes.
The cake is done if it bounces back when you touch it with your finger. Tip: If your cake top looks wrinkled or cracked, you may have overbaked it. Next time, check earlier to see if it‘s done. If the top is lighter in color and sticky, you may have underbaked it. Next time, you need to increase the oven temperature. I highly encourage you to check your actual oven temperature with an oven thermometer to see if it‘s running hotter than the display setting and adjust accordingly.
Remove the castella from the oven. To help prevent shrinkage, drop the pan twice onto the countertop to release the steam vapors from the cake. Next, invert the cake from the pan onto a nonstick silicone mat (I use Silpat and highly recommend it). Leave the parchment paper in place. Leave it upside down and let it cool to room temperature, about 45–60 minutes. Tip: I found that a nonstick silicone mat works perfectly here, as parchment paper may stick to the cake. However, if your cake sticks to the silicone mat, you may have underbaked it. Next time, increase the oven temperature or bake it a few minutes longer. Also, check your actual oven temperature to see if it's running cooler than the display setting and adjust accordingly.
To Chill Overnight
Once cooled, immediately wrap the cake with its parchment paper in plastic wrap to retain moisture. Then, put the wrapped cake in the refrigerator and store overnight (8–12 hours). This will help the cake develop a fine and moist texture.
To Trim the Castella
Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Discard the plastic and carefully peel off the parchment paper.
Now, we‘ll trim the sides of the castella to expose the yellow body of the cake. First, slice off the crust from the two long sides of the cake with a sharp bread knife (I highly recommend using a Suncraft bread knife). Use a damp towel to wipe off the crumbs from the blade after every cut. Tip: These castella crusts are moist and delicious to snack on!
Then, slice off the crust from the two short sides of the cake. Do not trim the top and bottom of the cake. Cut the cake crosswise into slices about ¾ inch (2 cm) thick. You will get 8–9 slices total.
To Serve
Serve it with tea or coffee, if you‘d like. Enjoy!

To Make the Batter
In a large bowl, combine 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), 140 g sugar (⅔ cup + ½ Tbsp), and 2 Tbsp honey. Whisk well until the mixture becomes fluffy.
Sift 1⅓ cups all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 1 tsp baking powder into the bowl with the egg mixture and mix until combined. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to rest the batter for 15 minutes.
After resting, the batter should be relaxed and slightly smoother. Now, stir in half of the 1–2 Tbsp water and check the consistency. It should be similar to pancake batter. Add more of the water, as needed, until you achieve the right consistency. Depending on the size of the eggs and how accurate your flour measurement is, the water amount may vary.
To Cook the Honey Pancakes
Heat a large nonstick frying pan over the lowest heat setting for 5 minutes. It‘s best to take your time and heat the pan slowly. When it is thoroughly heated with no hot spots, increase the heat to medium low. Dip a paper towel in neutral oil and coat the bottom of the pan with oil. Then, use another paper towel to remove the oil completely. This is the key to evenly golden brown Dorayaki pancakes. With a ladle or a small measuring cup (I use a 4 Tbsp measuring cup), pour 3 Tbsp of the batter from 3 inches (8 cm) above the pan to create a pancake that‘s 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter. Cook one pancake at a time.
When you see the surface of the batter starting to bubble, flip the pancake over and cook the other side. (With my stove and frying pan, it takes 1 minute and 15–30 seconds to cook one side and 20–30 seconds for the other side.) When done, transfer it to a plate and cover it with a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. Grease the pan between batches, as needed. Continue making the rest of the pancakes; you can make about 12 pancakes.
To Assemble the Dorayaki
Assemble the Dorayaki by making sandwiches using two pancakes and a scoop of the 1.1 lb sweet red bean paste (anko) as filling. Put more red bean paste in the center of the pancakes so the sandwich‘s middle is thicker than the edges and the Dorayaki's overall shape is curved. Wrap the Dorayaki with plastic wrap until ready to serve.

Gather all the ingredients. Equipment you will need: 12 aluminum/silicone cupcake liners, a medium cookie scoop (smaller than an ice cream scooper), a rolling pin, and a 3.5 inch (9 cm) cookie cutter or a round bowl/glass cup.
Using the cookie scoop, scoop out ice cream of your choice into aluminum/silicone cupcake liners. The ice cream will melt quickly so I recommend freezing them immediately for a few hours or until ice cream balls are completely frozen solid.
Once the ice cream balls are frozen solid and ready, you can start making mochi.

Once it’s cool down a bit, you can spread the mochi into a thin layer, about ⅛ inch (3 mm), with your hands or with a rolling pin. Make sure to apply potato starch on your hands and the rolling pin. I recommend using a rolling pin because it’s easier to evenly spread out.
Transfer the mochi with parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate for 15 minutes until the mochi is set.
Take out the mochi from the refrigerator and cut out 7–8 circles with the cookie cutter.
Dust off the excess potato starch with a pastry brush. If you find some sticky part, cover the area with potato starch first then dust off. Place a plastic wrap on a plate and then mochi wrapper on top, then lay another layer of plastic wrapper down. Repeat for all wrappers. With leftover mochi dough, roll into a ball and then flatten into a thin layer again and cut out into more circle wrappers (I could make about 12 mochi wrappers).
Now we’re ready to form mochi ice cream balls. On the work surface, place one sheet of plastic wrap with a mochi layer on top. Working quickly, place a scoop of ice cream into the center of the mochi wrapper. Pinch the four corners of the mochi layer together to wrap the ice cream ball. Repeat with the remaining mochi wrappers and ice cream balls.
When mochi gets sticky, put some potato starch on the sticky area and seal the opening. Quickly cover with the plastic wrap and twist to close. Place each mochi ice cream into a cupcake pan to keep the shape. You will need to work on one mochi ice cream at a time in order to keep the ice cream frozen at all times. Put mochi ice cream back into the freezer for at least 2–3 hours. When you’re ready to serve, keep them outside for a few minutes until outer mochi gets soften a little bit.
To Store

Crispy Taiyaki,"['1 cup cake flour (weigh your flour; for weights, click the Metric button; or use the “fluff and sprinkle“ method and level it off)', '⅔ cup milk (I used lactose-free 2% reduced fat milk, but you can also use whole or nonfat; use plant-based milk for vegan)', '1 tsp baking powder', '1 Tbsp sugar', '  sweet red bean paste (anko) (you can make my homemade Anko or Pressure Cooker Anko recipe; or substitute Nutella, custard, or your favorite filling)']","[{""ingredient"": ""milk"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""baking powder"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""sugar"", ""heat_processed"": true}, {""ingredient"": ""sweet red bean paste (anko)"", ""heat_processed"": true}]","Before You Start: Please note that I recommend a batter resting time of 1 hour (optional). You will need a taiyaki pan for this recipe. To get the right batter consistency, I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale. For weights, click the Metric button above. If you‘re using a cup measure, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more than you need. Now, gather all the ingredients. I also use a small ladle, a small offset spatula, a thermometer gun, cooking oil, and a silicone brush.
To Prepare the Batter
In a medium bowl, add ⅔ cup milk and 1 tsp baking powder and whisk together thoroughly.
Add 1 Tbsp sugar. Then, sift 1 cup cake flour into the mixture using a fine-mesh sieve.
Combine all the ingredients just until incorporated. Do not overmix the batter. If you have time, cover and rest the batter for one hour (optional). Tip: Set aside to relax the gluten in the batter while you prepare the filling, or else the pastry will have a chewy texture.
To Prepare the Filling
Pre-measure and pre-shape the sweet red bean paste (anko) filling so you can transfer the filling quickly and easily. I found it‘s easier to work with 2 tablespoons (40 g) of filling. You can use a 1.5-tablespoon cookie scoop and measure one heaping scoop for each filling. Using wet hands, form each filling into a long oval shape, with its length slightly shorter than the length of a taiyaki mold. Place on a tray or plate near your cooktop.
To Cook the Taiyaki
Heat the taiyaki pan thoroughly on low heat while you set up the work station. You‘ll need a dish with cooking oil, a pastry brush, a ladle (if you have a small one), an offset spatula (or knife), and a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Once the pan is warmed up thoroughly, turn up the stove‘s heat to medium-low to medium. Brush the oil inside and around the mold of the taiyaki pan. Stir the batter one last time. It should be a thick paste.
The 1st Round: When the taiyaki pan is thoroughly heated, spread the batter from the tail to the head in each mold. Fill it about one-third full. When you add the filling in the next step, it will push up the batter to fill the mold halfway.
Using the offset spatula (or knife), scoop up the anko filling, keeping its shape, and place it on top of the batter. Work quickly so the batter does not dry out.
Repeat for the next mold. Gently press down the fillings to flatten them and spread evenly into the empty spots of the mold.
Spoon a small portion of batter over the anko filling to cover it completely. If you see a spot that‘s not covered, spread the surrounding batter to cover it up without pouring more. The mold should be about three-quarters full of batter and filling. Tip: The key is to use less batter here to avoid overflow.
Close the lid and immediately flip the pan. Cook for 2½ to 3 minutes on that side.
Then, flip the pan again and cook for another 2½ to 3 minutes.
Open the pan and check if the taiyaki is cooked; it‘s done when the pastry is golden brown. Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack. I used a wooden skewer to loosen the pastry from the mold. Tip: If your batter overflowed a bit, don‘t worry. You will trim the edges later.
The Next Round: Cook the remaining taiyaki. If the mold has some burnt spots, typically from the sweet red bean paste sticking to the pan and burning, wipe it off with a paper towel or simply wash it off and start clean. This way, your next taiyaki will have a clean crust. Now, I‘ll show you what happens when I pour too much batter and don‘t cover the filling completely.
As soon as I placed the anko filling, the batter rose to the edge of the mold.
I still had to cover the filling, so I added more batter. Luckily, the batter is thick so it stayed in place rather than sliding down. See the amount of batter here.
When I closed the pan, there was too much batter in each mold, so it spread to the sides.
Despite the overflow, you can continue to cook it. When it‘s done, your taiyaki will have extra crispy edges around the pastry. Some prefer this style of taiyaki, but my recipe doesn‘t include enough batter to do that. Also, note that the red bean paste filling squeezed out of the pastry. This happened because I did not cover the filling completely, so the hot pan heated the bean paste, which exploded and burned.
To Trim the Pastry
Let the taiyaki cool on the wire rack. Cut off any excess pastry around the edges of the taiyaki with a pair of kitchen scissors.
To Serve
Serve the Crispy Taiyaki warm. If the taiyaki get cold, you can toast them in the toaster oven or oven until they‘re crispy on the outside.
To Store
You can keep the taiyaki in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, toast them in the toaster oven or heat in the oven at 350ºF (180ºC) until they‘re crispy on the outside.",en,True,"[""Japanese""]",False,True,
