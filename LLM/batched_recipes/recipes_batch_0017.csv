Combine the 4 oz. julienned pork shoulder with 1 tablespoon water until the meat has absorbed the water. Add a pinch of salt, 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch and mix until combined. Set aside.
Prepare your dry ingredients:
Cut the dried chilies in half and discard the seeds. Mince them up and set aside.
In separate bowls, soak the dried lily flowers, wood ears, and shiitake mushrooms in 1 cup of water each for 1-2 hours, until hydrated. Using hot water (like you’re brewing tea) will significantly speed up the process.
Once they’re ready, thinly slice the mushrooms and give the wood ears a rough chop. Trim the tough ends off the lily flowers and cut them in half.
Prepare the tofu and the rest of the ingredients:
Cut both the spiced tofu and the firm tofu into 2-inch long and ¼-inch thick pieces. Julienne the bamboo shoots. Beat the egg in a small bowl. Wash and chop the scallion and set aside.
Assemble the soup:
Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a wok or pot. If the pork has clumped and stuck together, it is best to add another tablespoon of water to loosen it up before adding it to the soup.
Stir in the pork and quickly break up any clumps that may form. Once the soup is simmering again, skim off any foam that floats to the top with a fine meshed strainer.
Add the salt, sugar, dried chili pepper (if using), white pepper, both soy sauces, and sesame oil.
Next, add the lily flowers, wood ears, shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots and bring the soup to a simmer once again.
Next, add the two kinds of tofu and the vinegar and stir. It should start to look and smell like the real thing about now!
Combine the ⅓ cup cornstarch with ¼ cup water to make a slurry. Ensure it’s well-combined, as the cornstarch tends to settle to the bottom of the bowl.
Bring the mixture to a simmer and use your soup ladle to stir the soup in a steady circular motion to make a whirlpool while slowly drizzling in the cornstarch slurry. This prevents the cornstarch from clumping. Stop when you’re about ¾ of the way done with your slurry and keep stirring until the soup comes back up to a simmer.
Check the consistency of the soup, as it should be thick enough to coat your spoon or ladle. Add the rest of the cornstarch slurry if you like it thicker.
Adjust seasoning:
Once the soup is the thickness you prefer, use a spoon to check its flavor and adjust things to your own personal preference. Add more white pepper if you like it hot and add more vinegar if like it sour! White pepper gives the soup its signature heat, and the vinegar levels can be adjusted according to how sour you like your hot and sour soup.
Keep the soup simmering (it should be bubbling before you add the egg, or the soup will turn cloudy when the egg is added), and begin stirring in a circular motion with your ladle once again. Once you get the soup moving in a slowly swirling motion, slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the soup.

In a large mixing bowl or mixer with a dough hook attachment, completely dissolve yeast and sugar in lukewarm water. Wait 10-15 minutes to let the yeast become active and foam up.
Add in the flour ½ cup at a time and knead for about 15 minutes. Adjust the last ½ cup flour accordingly. The dough should be soft––not sticky and not too firm. Once the dough is even and smooth, form it into a ball. Cover it with a damp kitchen towel and let it proof one hour in a warm place. (If kneading by hand, knead the dough until it’s as smooth as a baby’s butt!) While it’s proofing, make the filling.
To make the filling:
Add the ground meat to a large mixing bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons water until well incorporated.
Now preheat the wok or a cast iron pan until it starts to smoke lightly. Add in 3 tablespoons oil, along with the minced ginger and diced onion. Cook over medium heat until the onions soften. Add in the ground pork and turn up the heat, stirring to break up any large chunks. Cook until all the pork turns pale and opaque––there is no need to brown or crisp the meat.
Add wine, dark soy sauce, sweet bean sauce, ground bean sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, white pepper, and sesame oil. With the heat on high, stir everything together until well-combined. Taste the filling and adjust seasoning if needed.
Cook for a couple of more minutes to cook off any remaining liquid. Stir in the cornstarch and water mixture, allowing everything to bubble together for 30 seconds to a minute. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool uncovered. After the filling has cooled, mix in the chopped scallions.
To assemble the baozi (buns):
After the dough has finished proofing, turn it out onto a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead for 2 minutes to get rid of any air pockets. Weigh and divide the dough into 20 equal pieces (each should weigh about 48g-50g).
Take each dough ball, and with a rolling pin, roll it from the edge towards the center, without actually rolling the center of the dough. The goal is to flatten the dough into a round circle with a thinner edge and thicker center. The difference in thickness should be about 1:2. Add some filling to the center.
You can start with a smaller amount of filling until you get the hang of the folding/pleating. The buns are folded with one hand holding the skin and filling, and the other hand pleating the edges of the dough disk like an accordion. As you fold, the goal is to make it all the way around the circle, until you’ve sealed it at the top. You’ll be making about 10-15 folds. Lay the buns on a small piece of parchment paper and put it directly on your steaming rack. Repeat until all are assembled. Let the buns proof (covered) for another 15 minutes before steaming.
If you’d rather not pleat the buns at all, simply pinch the edges of dough around the filling and pinch to seal tightly. Then simply flip the buns seam side down, cover, and proof for 15 minutes.
To steam:
With the buns in the steamer, start with cold water and turn on the heat to medium. Set the timer to 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, turn off the heat, and keep the lid on. Let the buns “rest” for 5 minutes before opening the lid. Missing this step will cause the buns to collapse.
To store leftovers and reheat:
Once the buns are steamed and cooled completely, pack them in an airtight container. They can be refrigerated or frozen.
Out of the refrigerator, simply microwave the buns for 1-2 minutes. Alternatively, re-steam them for 5 minutes. If re-heating frozen buns, there’s no need to thaw beforehand. Simply steam them for 8 minutes.",en,True,,False,False
Pork and Celery Dumplings,"['4 tablespoons vegetable oil ((divided))', '1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns ((optional))', '7-8 ounces Chinese celery ((or regular celery, thoroughly washed and very finely minced))', '1 teaspoon salt', '2 ounces carrot ((finely chopped; 2 ounces or 55g = about 1/3 cup packed))', '2 scallions ((minced))', '1 tablespoon ginger ((very finely minced))', '1 1/4 pound ground pork', '2 teaspoons sugar', '2 teaspoons sesame oil', '2 teaspoons oyster sauce', '2 tablespoons light soy sauce', '3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine', '1/2 cup water', '2 packages dumpling wrappers ((or 1 recipe homemade dumpling wrappers, below))', '4 cups all purpose flour', '1 1/3 cup tepid water']",,"Optional step to make your own dumpling wrapper dough:
If you’re making your own dumpling wrappers, start by preparing the dough. Put the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the water. When a dough forms, continue kneading on low speed for about 8 minutes. (Alternatively, put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add the water to the flour and knead into a smooth dough. This process should take about 10 minutes.) Cover with an overturned plate and let the dough rest for 1 hour.
To make the filling:
Take your minced celery, and add 1 teaspoon salt. Allow to sit for 30 minutes, and the celery will sweat out excess water.
In a small saucepan or pot, add 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and the Sichuan peppercorns, if using. Place over medium heat, and when the oil starts to bubble around the peppercorns, turn the heat down to medium low. Allow the oil to infuse for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool completely. If not using Sichuan peppercorns, simply cook the oil over medium heat for 5 minutes, and let cool. This “cooked” oil will give the dumplings more flavor than you’d get by simply adding raw oil to the filling.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a small pan or wok over medium heat. Fry the carrots in the oil until the carrots are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cool completely.
Squeeze out the excess water from the celery, and add to the bowl of your stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl), along with the cooked and cooled carrot, minced scallions, minced ginger, ground pork, sugar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, and soy sauce.
Turn on your mixer (fitted with the paddle attachment) on low speed, and gradually stream in the Shaoxing wine and water.
Continue mixing on low speed for 5-7 minutes, until the mixture has emulsified, absorbed the added liquid, and resembles a sticky paste. Alternatively, mix by hand with a pair of chopsticks in 1 direction for 10 minutes, or as long as it takes to yield an emulsified paste. If you do not mix long enough, your filling may look wet and have a grainy texture after cooking.
Remove the peppercorns from the cooled oil, and add the oil to the filling mixture. Mix again on low speed for 1 minute, just until the oil is emulsified into the mixture. That’s the filling!
To assemble the dumplings:
If you made homemade dumpling wrappers, divide the dough into small pieces (each piece should weigh about 15-20g), and roll it into a ball in your hands. Flatten the ball on a clean, smooth surface (such as a cutting board or clean countertop), and roll into a thin 3½ inch circle. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle, and pleat the dumplings closed.
If using store-bought dumpling wrappers, moisten the outer edges of the wrapper, and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle. Pleat the dumpling closed, using additional water to make sure the dumpling is fully sealed. For more detail on this step, check out our post on How to Fold Dumplings 4 Ways.
Place on a parchment lined baking sheet ½ inch apart so the dumplings aren’t touching. At this point, you can wrap the dumplings and freeze them on the tray. Then transfer to a freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. (No need to thaw them before steaming, pan-frying, or boiling).

Toss the chicken wings in the flour mixture, adding a few handfuls to the marinade bowl until the wings are thoroughly coated. Using the same bowl as the one the wings marinated in is key, as the accumulated liquid in the bowl helps the flour coat them. You may not need all the flour, so add it a handful at a time.
Space the chicken wings evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the wings lightly with oil.

How to Freeze Herbs & Aromatics,"['cilantro', 'ginger', 'scallions', 'chilies/peppers', 'lemongrass']",,"To freeze cilantro:
Trim the bottom stems of the cilantro and soak in a bowl of cold water to rid the herbs of any dirt or sand. Wash in a bowl of fresh water a couple more times to ensure it's clean.
Thoroughly dry the cilantro leaves and stems using a salad spinner and/or clean kitchen towel.
Put in a freezer bag (preferably reusable!) with any air pressed out of it and freeze.
Do not defrost; just add directly to cooked dishes.
To freeze ginger:
Use a vegetable peeler, paring knife, or spoon to peel the entire piece of ginger.
Slice the ginger into discs.
Place the ginger slices into a freezer bag, press out any air, seal, and freeze!
No need to defrost before chopping, mincing, and adding to cooked dishes. Can also be used in raw applications.
To freeze scallions:
Wash the scallions and dry them thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel.
Trim off the very ends of the scallions (where the roots are).
Dice, julienne, or slice the scallions however you like, put in freezer bags, press out any air, and seal before transferring to the freezer.
Do not defrost; just add directly to cooked dishes.
To freeze chilies or peppers:
Keeping the chilies whole, wash them under cool running water.
Dry them thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel.
Transfer to freezer bags and freeze.
Only Thai bird chilies are small enough to be defrosted and added to raw dishes. For larger chilies, thaw slightly (enough to cut through them), before chopping and adding to cooked dishes.
To freeze lemongrass:
Trim off the ends and woody tops, and pull away any tough or old outer leaves.
Cut the remaining stalk into 4-inch lengths.
Transfer to freezer bags and freeze.
If the lemongrass is to be added whole to a recipe, there is no need to thaw in advance. If, however, you need to chop the lemongrass or add it to a food processor to make a marinade, you can thaw it beforehand.",en,True,,True,True

How to Steam Food: 3 Ways to Set Up a Steamer,"['A pot or wok with a lid', 'A heat-proof dish that can fit inside the wok or pot', 'Something to prop up the dish above the water ((like a metal steam rack or a clean metal can))', 'A stainless steel steamer', 'A bamboo steamer']",,"For Steamer Set-up 1: A Pot or Wok with Rack & Heatproof Dish
Find a pot with a lid that will accommodate the heatproof dish you plan to steam your food in (a wok with a lid is ideal). Place a metal steam rack in the bottom of the wok/pot so that it's at least 2 inches above the water (you'll want more water for longer steaming times). If you don't have a metal steam rack, you can use an empty can with both ends removed. When the water is simmering, place the heatproof dish of food on the rack, cover the wok or pot, and steam.
For Steamer Set-up 2: Metal Steamer
Fill the bottom of the metal steamer with at least 2 inches of water (or more for longer steaming times). Place food either in a heatproof dish, or if steaming buns/dumplings, line the racks with cabbage leaves, cheesecloth, or paper steamer liners to cook the buns/dumplings directly on the racks without them sticking. Bring the water to a simmer, cover, and steam. To prevent condensation from dripping onto the food below, you can tie a thin kitchen towel around the lid (so that cloth is on the inside of the lid to catch any condensation), tying any loose edges so they're not in danger of coming in contact with your heat source.
For Steamer Set-up 3: Bamboo Steamer
Place the bamboo steamer in your wok with enough water to come up the bottom rim of the steamer by 1/2-inch (1.25cm). You can either place shallow heatproof dishes inside the steamer racks, or line the racks with cabbage leaves, cheesecloth, or paper steamer liners to steam buns or dumplings. Bring the water to a simmer, and cover the bamboo steamer with its bamboo lid (there's no need for any additional cover).",en,True,,False,False
How to Season a Wok,"['carbon steel wok', 'heavy duty aluminum foil', 'gas stove or outside burner ((gas is best, though you can also do this on an electric stove))', 'oven mitt or dry kitchen towel', 'scrub sponge or scouring pad', 'paper towel ((for wiping oil onto the wok))', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil']",,"If your wok has wooden handles, wrap them in heavy duty aluminum foil to prevent them from burning.
Set your wok on your stove set to the highest heat. Make sure you clear the stove area, because things will get quite hot. Keep a dry kitchen towel handy or better yet, a silicon/heatproof kitchen mitt in case the wok handles get too hot.
Once the wok heats up, it will start turning a dark brown color and begin to smoke. This indicates that the residual oils from the wok are burning off. Next, the wok will begin superheating and the impurities from those industrial oils will burn off. Tilt the wok to superheat one area at a time, until the entire wok surface has taken on a blue tint.
Turn off the burner and set the wok back on the stove to cool for a few minutes. Carefully pour about 1 cup of hot water into the wok to cool it off.
When your wok is completely cooled, move it to your sink and give it a light scrubbing (you can use a small amount of dish soap). Rinse your wok thoroughly with clean water. You may see some dark spots in the metal from impurities in the carbon steel, but this is nothing to worry about.
Wipe down the excess water with a paper towel and place the wok back on the burner to dry it over medium high heat.
After the wok is thoroughly dried, add about a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wok over low heat. Spread the oil around the wok by tilting it until you get an even coating. Turn off the heat and use a twice-folded paper towel to begin wiping down the wok. Use your wok spatula to start since the wok will be hot.
Repeat this wash/dry process one more time (and each time you use your wok) and your new carbon steel wok is ready for cooking your favorite dishes!",en,True,,False,False

Sift in the powder sugar, add the vanilla, and orange zest then mix on low until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Taste for sweet adjustment and add another tablespoon of powered sugar if desired. To loosen the icing, you can add a few teaspoons of orange juice.
Store the icing in a lidded container, in the refrigerator, if not icing the bread after it cools. Bring to room temperature before slathering!
Ice the Bread/Cake
Because cream cheese needs to be refrigerated, consider how/when you'll share the cake before icing it. An iced cake needs to be consumed, refrigerated or frozen within three hours. An uniced cake can set covered at room temperature for up to three days.Ice the Cake: Once the loaf cake is cool and just before serving, spread the icing evenly over the top of the cake. Slice and share within three hours.Individual Pieces: Once the loaf is cool, slice the loaf and share with a dollop or slather of cream cheese icing. *Uniced carrot cake bread is lovely toasted or warmed, then slathered with cream cheese icing!
For Storing
Room Temperature: Store an iced loaf cake at room temperature (70F or less) for up to three hours. Afterwards, store the cake in the fridge, covered for up to three days. Before serving, pull the cake from the fridge and rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the fats to soften. Food safety says cheese should set out for no more than three hours. An uniced loaf cake can be stored covered at room temperature for up to three days.
To Freeze: This cake freezes beautifully, iced or uniced. Simply allow the cake to cool completely, ice the cake or not, then freeze individual pieces on a sheet pan. Once frozen wrap snugly in plastic wrap or store in a lidded container. Store in freezer then thaw at room temperature for about two hours before enjoying. If iced, take the plastic wrap off before thawing so the icing doesn't stick. I've only tested freezing the iced cake for up to two days. Uniced will freeze well for up to two weeks.

In a 10"" (25cm) oven proof skillet (I use cast iron), heat the olive oil until shimmering. Turn heat down to low and add the onions. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally for about 15 minutes, or until tender and slightly darker in color. While the onions are cooking, fill a medium stock pot 1/2 full with water. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the broccoli rabe or broccolini and blanch for 3 minutes. Drain and run cold water over the broccoli. Trim ends, then cut into about 2"" (5cm) lengths, reserving 2-3 full stalks to add to the top for a pretty presentation (optional). Set aside.
Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl, add the pesto-spinach whipped ricotta, salt, pepper, and pepper flakes. Using a whisk, whip the egg mixture until the ingredients are distributed and come together. Set aside.
Once the onions are tender, add the cut broccoli, and garlic and push the ingredients around in the pan to evenly distribute them.

Add the cabbage to the leeks. Cook on medium low stirring occasionally to cook down, about 9-10 minutes (the pot will be full).
Add garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, broth, potatoes and thyme bundle. Bring to a simmer, then cook on a low simmer for about 20 minutes for a fork tender potato (this will vary depending on type of potato and size of cut, so test to taste), or 40 minutes to let the potatoes soften further (this time is flexible - cooking the potatoes longer will allow them to be more creamy and melt into the soup - yum!)
Remove the thyme bundle, stir in the beans and a good squeeze of lemon (it brightens the soup). Warm through, about five minutes. Taste to adjust salt and pepper seasoning as needed. Due to variations in salt content in vegetable broth, add salt to taste. I'm pretty generous with it in this recipe (beyond the 1/2 teaspoon). If the soup tastes bland to you, it needs more salt. Garnish with shaved parmesan and fresh thyme leaves if desired.

Make sure the chickpeas are patted dry and the artichokes squeezed of their canned liquid. In the work bowl of a food processor, add the chickpeas and artichokes. Pulse 4-5 times. The mixture should be chunky. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
In the work bowl of the food processor, add the red and green bell peppers, onion, celery, and parsley. Process until minced, stopping to scrape down the bowl a few times. Transfer to the large mixing bowl with the chickpea mixture. Rinse out the work bowl and set aside if making the remoulade (see below).
To the chickpea mixture, add the dijon, mayo, 1 C (96g) of panko, salt, old bay, cayenne, chickpea flour and lemon. Mix thoroughly until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. The mixture should hold together when squeezed.
To portion the crabless cakes, use a 1/4 C (70g) scoop or large cookie scoop. Pack the mixture in the scoop, then tap it gently but firmly on the side of the bowl to release the cake. Set the cake on a parchment lined sheet pan. Note! If baking the crabless cakes, there's no need to coat the patties in remaining panko. Skip to ""To Bake"" below.Place the remaining 1/2 C (48) panko bread crumbs into a bowl or plate. Place each cake in the panko to coat on both sides and all around the edges. Transfer back to the sheet pan. Using the palm of your hand, press the crab cake gently into a 1/2"" (12mm) patty. At this point the crab cakes can be held in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, frozen or pan fried.
To Freeze: Once all the cakes are coated, they can be frozen on the sheet pan. Once frozen, transfer to a storage container for up to two months. Thaw at room temperature or in the refrigerator and coat in panko again to refresh before frying.
To Pan Fry (recommended): Preheat oven to 200F (93C) if holding the cakes warm after pan frying. Otherwise, you won't need the oven on. Pour a shallow layer of oil in a frying pan. I like a cast iron skillet for the job. Heat the oil until it shimmers. Toss a crumb of panko in the pan. If it sizzles, the oil is ready. Using a spatula, gently slide the crab cakes into the pan, leaving room between the cakes for flipping. Cook on each side for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Adjust the heat as necessary. Transfer to a double layer of paper towel to catch pan drippings and sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the crabless cake. Then, if holding warm, transfer to the oven until ready to eat.
To Bake: Omit the outer layer of panko. Preheat the oven to 400F (204C) and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Brush both sides of the crabless cake with oil. Bake each side for 10 minutes.
Serve With (optional): chives, and sauce of choice

Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and toast pine nuts for 6-7 minutes, or until toasty and fragrant. Set aside to cool.
Roast the Veggies:
Turn oven up to 425F (218C). Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the mushrooms, bell peppers, asparagus, tomatoes, garlic and shallot on one pan. Sprinkle with 2 Tbs of olive oil. Using a spatula, mix all the veggies together with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper then stir again. Move 1/2 the veggie mixture to the other sheet pan. Spread the veggies in one layer, making sure there's no overlapping on both pans.

Cook the Orzo:
In a large saute pan, heat 1 Tbs of Olive Oil on medium heat until shimmering. Add the orzo and stir, coating the orzo thoroughly. Stir occasionally for about 3 minutes or until the orzo is toasty and golden. Add the vegetable broth. Be careful here because the broth will spit and sputter. Bring to a simmer, turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. Stir. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.
Make the Dressing:
In a small bowl add the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Whisk until all the ingredients are emulsified.

Get Ready: Spray a 9""x9""x2"" (23x23cm) baking pan with grease, then line the pan with parchment paper, and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add the warmed milk, sprinkle yeast over the top, and add a pinch of sugar. Whisk and set aside for 15 minutes to proof. It will be bubbly and frothy when ready. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, pour the rum over the currants/raisins, cover and warm for 30 seconds in the microwave. This will plump them up. Drain, pressing the currants/raisins through a fine strainer just before using in the recipe.
Mix: To the frothy milk/yeast mixture, add 2 eggs, cooled melted butter, vanilla extract, and maple syrup. Whisk thoroughly. To the wet ingredients, add the flour, cardamom, cinnamon, and sea salt. Use a wooden spoon to mix first, then as the ingredients come together mix by hand until there are no dry patches. Add the lemon and orange zest and the drained currants/raisins. Using one hand, gently lift and press the dough over and onto itself while rotating the bowl in quarter turns with each fold with the other hand. Do this for about one minute to thoroughly mix in the zest and currants/raisins. The dough will feel soft and greasy.
Knead: Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Actively knead the dough for about 9-10 minutes until the dough has a tacky, not sticky, feel to it. If the dough sticking to your hands and/or work surface, dust with flour and continue kneading.
First Rise: Roll into a ball by tucking the edges in underneath. Place in a lightly greased clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm location to rise (see tip in notes) to double in size.
Divide and Shape: Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently roll the dough into a log and divide into 12 equal pieces (use a scale if you have one to portion each piece to about 74 grams each). Roll each piece into a ball and place into the parchment lined baking pan. (see options A and B for finishing the buns).Second Rise (proof): A. Overnight Buns: Cover the buns with plastic wrap and place the buns in the refrigerator overnight (8-24 hours). In the morning, remove them from the refrigerator and allow buns to rise until almost doubled in size. When ready, they should be squishing against one another. Use the TIP in the notes to speed this process along (my overnight buns take about two hours to proof after removing them from the refrigerator using the oven proof method). B. Same Day Buns: Cover the buns with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and set buns in warm spot to rise (proof) until almost doubled in size. When ready, they should be squishing against one another. Use the TIP in the notes to speed this process along. (my same day buns take about one hour to proof using the oven proof method).
If using the oven to proof your buns, remove the buns from the oven before preheating the oven. Bake: Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). Crack the remaining egg into a bowl and whisk with one tablespoon of water. Brush the tops of the buns with egg wash and bake for 23-25 minutes. If they're getting too dark, loosely place a piece of foil over the pan. The buns are done when a digital food thermometer inserted into the buns read between 190- 195 Fahrenheit (87 – 90 Celsius). The tops will be golden brown.
Finish: Remove from oven and place on a cooling rack. Cool completely before piping the mascarpone icing crosses. You can also share the buns warm without the cross, and serve the mascarpone icing on the side. Aternatively, cool 5-10 minutes, then add the optional the drizzle (see notes).
For the Mascarpone Icing (see notes for alternative drizzle):
In a small bowl, add the mascarpone. Sift in the powdered sugar, add the orange zest and vanilla beans. Gently mix the icing just until the ingredients come together. Do not whisk or mix vigorously or the mixture could break. Transfer half the icing to a piping or zip bag and cut a small opening at the tip. Refrigerate the icing until ready to pipe. Once the buns are cool, pipe the icing in a cross shape over the buns. Share the remaining icing on the side for slathering. Alternatively, you can share warm buns with the icing on the side.

In a small pan or heat proof container, melt the butter on low heat on stove top or in the microwave. Set aside to cool slightly.
Transfer one cup of mini eggs to a plastic bag and gently tap the eggs with the end of a rolling pin to break them into smaller bits. I like to do this in two batches breaking up one batch in halves, and the other into smaller bits. Transfer to a bowl and set aside, keeping the remaining whole eggs nearby for finishing/decorating later. Alternatively you can chop them with a knife.
Mix the Cookie Dough:
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk brown sugar, cane sugar and melted butter until the butter is incorporated into the sugars. Add the whole egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture all at once. Mix with a wooden spoon until there are only a few flour patches left. The dough will become thick and stiff as you mix.
To the cookie dough, add the cracked mini eggs and chocolate chips. Use your hands to fold and mix in the mini egg bits and chocolate chips, just until evenly distributed in the dough.
Scoop and Bake:
Scoop cookies using a number 40 cookie scoop or portion to 1 1/2 tablespoons each, then roll into a ball.

Grease a 9"" x 2"" (22 x 5 cm) round cake pan thoroughly on the sides and bottom. Line the bottom with parchment paper and grease the top of the parchment paper. Be sure to get the corners good! Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).
Place the nuts on a small sheet pan and put them in the oven while the oven is preheating. Toast the nuts for about 10-15 minutes, or until the nuts are fragrant and starting to turn slightly darker. Chop fine when cool. Scoop out 1/4 C (25g) for sprinkling on the top of the finished cake. Set aside.
In a medium mixing bowl, add the flour, corn starch, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk to combine. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, add the brown sugar and cane sugar, and whisk in the oil until ingredients are combined, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla. Whisk until the ingredients are emulsified, about 20 seconds. Add the pineapple to the egg mixture and whisk until the pineapple is evenly distributed. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Using a silicone spatula, gently mix until no flour streaks remain. If using coconut oil, the batter will start to stiffen at this point because the coconut oil is cooling (solidifying). Working quickly, fold in the shredded carrots and nuts. If using canola oil, the batter should be thick but loose and almost pourable. For coconut oil, the batter should be stiff and thick.
Transfer the cake batter to the cake pan and using an offset spatula, and smooth the batter into an even layer. If using coconut oil, spread the batter while pressing it into the pan. Tap the pan on the counter to disperse any air pockets.
Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes. The cake is ready when it's golden, a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean, the cake slightly springs back under gentle pressure at center, and the edges of the cake are just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes on a cooling wrack. Turn cake out on to a plate or cutting board to release. Give it a gentle tap if needed. If it doesn't budge, ease the edges with a pairing knife by running the knife around the sides of the cake. Then flip back over on to cooling rack, so that the top is showing. Cool completely before icing (about 2 hours).
For the Icing:
While the cake is cooling, in a medium mixing bowl, add the mascarpone. Sift the powdered sugar into the bowl and add the vanilla beans and zest. Stir with a silicone spatula just to combine, do not whip. It should be soft and spreadable. Put a lid on the icing and store it in the fridge for at least 1 1/2 hours (up to two days), until you're ready to ice the cake. It will firm up a bit as it chills.
Ice the Cake:
Because mascarpone needs to be refrigerated, consider how/when you'll share the cake before icing. An iced cake needs to be refrigerated within three hours. An uniced cake can set covered at room temperature for up to three days. Ice the Whole Cake: Once the cake is cool and just before serving, take the icing from the fridge and spread it over the cake. Finish the cake with a sprinkle of the remaining finely chopped pecans or walnuts if desired. Share within three hours. Individual Pieces: Once the cake is cool, slice the cake and share with a dollop or slather of chilled mascarpone. **See recipe notes for tips on cutting clean cake edges.
For Storage:
Room Temperature: Store an iced cake at room temperature (70F or less) for up to three hours. Afterwards, store the cake in the fridge, covered for up to three days. Before serving, pull the cake from the fridge and rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the fats to soften. I have stored the cake at room temperature for over 24 hours and it was fine for us, but food safety says cheese should set out for no more than three hours. An uniced cake can be stored covered at room temperature for up to three days. To Freeze: This cake freezes beautifully, iced or uniced. Simply allow the cake to cool completely, ice the cake or not, then freeze individual pieces on a sheet pan. Once frozen wrap snugly in plastic wrap or or store in a lidded container. Store in freezer then thaw at room temperature for about two hours before enjoying. If iced, take the plastic wrap off before thawing so the icing doesn't stick.

Discarded Sourdough Pizza Dough (same day or overnight),"['1/2 cup (130 grams) Sourdough Discard (100% hydration stirred down, from the fridge)', '3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (180 grams) Water (105-110 Fahrenheit (41 Celsius) **See note on Hydration & *refrigerator proof)', '1 tablespoon (10 grams) Extra Virgin Olive Oil (plus more for proofing vessels)', '3/4 teaspoon Instant Yeast (aka Quick Rise Yeast)', '1 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt', '1 3/4 cups (250 grams) Unbleached Bread Flour', '1/4 cup (40 grams) Whole Wheat Flour']",,"Mix the Dough:
In the bowl of a stand mixer add the sourdough discard, water, olive oil, instant yeast, salt, bread flour, and whole wheat flour.
Attach the dough hook, and mix at speed 4 for 12 - 13 minutes. Mix until the dough reaches 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius) AND passes the windowpane test (see blog post). The dough will be soft and sticky, but supple.*Alternatively, you can mix and knead with your hands. This will take about 15 +/- minutes of active kneading.This is a good time to prepare your proofing vessels. I use 4 cup (950mL) lidded glass bowls for this - one for each ball. It helps the dough hold it's shape, there's room to rise and they're reusable. Zip top or reusable bags may be used. Brush the interior of your vessel thoroughly with olive oil to prevent sticking.
Pre-Shape the Dough:
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide into two equal pieces.
Shape each piece into a rough round by folding each side to the middle, then the top and bottom. Flip the dough over shape the dough into dough balls. If the dough is sliding around, use your bench scraper to scrape away the flour and very lightly sprits the work surface with water. This helps the dough grip the surface. See how to shape video in blog post above or longer format video below for tutorial.Make sure the skin/surface is taught, then transfer the dough to it's proofing vessel seam side down. Put a lid on the container or seal the bag. See recipe note* below for retarding the dough in the refrigerator (up to three days!).(optional) Freeze the Dough: If you opt to freeze your dough, this is the time to do it. Freeze in zip top bags or in their glass storage containers. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then carry on with proofing the following day. Note that the dough doesn't quite bake up as beautifully as fresh dough, but freezing is an option.
Proof the Dough :
Proof the dough at room temperature for about two to two and a half hours (this at a kitchen temperature of 68F). The warmer the kitchen, the quicker the rise. Keep an eye on it. When is the Dough Ready? The dough is ready to make pizza when it's risen between over one and a half times to doubling in size, is puffy and springy to the touch (it's pretty forgiving - just make sure it's at room temp). TIP: In a Hurry? If you want to proof to move along quicker, pop the dough balls in their proofing vessel, in the oven with the oven turned off and the light on. This will speed the process a bit.
Getting Ready to Bake:
Prepare the Oven: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. If making a second pizza, set another rack two positions below the top one. You can easily bake two pizzas at a time. Place an upside down sheet pan and/or a pizza stone on a rack, one on each rack if baking two pizzas. If you proofed the dough in your turned off oven, remove the dough now.Preheat the Oven & Pan/Stone: to between 500 - 550 Fahrenheit (260-287 Celcius). Ovens vary in their maximum temperature setting. My new oven maxes out at 525 Fahrenheit, so that's the temperature I bake pizza at (previous oven at 550F). Preheat for at least 45 minutes.
Have a sheet of parchment paper ready for each pizza you're making. Also, have a pizza peel or sheet pan standing by to slide the shaped and topped dough on for transferring the unbaked pizza to the oven and onto preheated pan and/or baking stone.Prepare Toppings: Just before getting ready to shape the final dough, gather and prepare all your ingredients, chopping small or slicing thin.
Let's Make Pizza!
Shape the Pizza Dough (see VIDEO below): Gently nudge the dough out of the proofing vessel and onto a floured surface trying to keep it in a round as best you can. Flour the top and edges of the dough generously. If it's sticking to anything, sprinkle a bit more flour. a. Dimple the dough using your fingertips on both hands gently pressing down to the surface of the board (think focaccia) 4-5 times. Avoid the outer 1/4 inch - 1/2 inch (.63 cm - 1.27 cm) of the dough - this is your crust edge. b. Using the tips of your fingers just inside of the edge work the dough all the way around the edge while the dough hangs gently, touching the work surface.c. Using the palm of your hands, toss the dimpled dough between your hands, back and fourth a few times. The dough will continue stretching. Place the dough on the work surface and observe its shape, gently tugging and rebounding edges that need it, to form a circle. d. Pick the dough up and place it on the back of your fisted and floured hands, gently pulling and stretching the dough while moving your hands to transfer the points of contact with the dough. Shape into a disc shape, taking care not to rip the dough. Place back down on your floured surface. Is the shape how you like it? If not give it a few stretches again using the back of your hands until you're happy with the shape. The dough should measure about 11 inches (28cm). Don't worry if it's not perfectly round - a rectangle or irregular shape works too! If you feel the dough is tight, place it on the work surface and let it rest for about 5 minutes before you attempt shaping again. It will relax as it rests. If making two pizzas, shape them both, one after another.Transfer each pizza round to a piece of parchment paper and if desired, trim the edges of the parchment flush with the pizza dough, leaving an overhang to act as a handle where needed. Note that parchment paper is generally rated for use under 500 Fahrenheit. So at 550 Fahrenheit, with overhang, the paper will char and become brittle.
Add the Toppings - less is more. See blog post for topping suggestions and a crispier option in the notes**
Bake the Pizza:
Working quickly (you don’t want the raw dough with the toppings to hang out too long), transfer the pizza onto a pizza peel or the back of a sheet pan using the parchment as a handle if needed. Open the oven and pull out the rack with the preheated stone or pan. Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone and/or pan using the parchment as a handle. Be careful as the oven is HOT! Repeat with the second pizza if making two. Bake the assembled pizza(s) at 500 - 550 Fahrenheit for 7-10 minutes OR until the dough is golden brown with some charring, the cheese has melted and sauce is bubbly. The hotter the oven, the quicker the bake, so keep an eye on it! Remove the pizza(s) from the oven and allow to rest for five minutes. Cut into 8 equal pieces each and enjoy!

Soft Homemade Cranberry Orange Sourdough Bread Recipe,"['1/4 cup (50 grams) Sourdough Starter (100% hydration, previously fed, doubled in size)', '1 1/4 cup (270 grams) Water (80 degrees fahrenheit (26 celsius) )', '1 tablespoon Orange Zest (from about three large oranges, like Cara Cara)', '1/3 cup (75 grams) Orange Juice (fresh squeezed)', '5 tablespoons (95 grams) Honey (or maple syrup* (see note))', '3 1/2 cups + 3 tablespoons (475 grams) Unbleached Bread Flour', '1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (50 grams) Whole Wheat Flour (stone ground)', '1 1/2 teaspoons (9 grams) Fine Sea Salt', '1 cup (145 grams) Dried Cranberries (apple juice sweetened**, rough chopped)']",,"Mix the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, using a fork, mix the sourdough starter, water, orange zest and juice, and honey.
To the wet ingredients, add the bread flour, whole wheat flour and salt. First, mix with a fork, the dough will be shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. The dough will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become. The dough will feel stiff and it will stick to your fingers as you go. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. Then, use the fork to scrape the dough off your fingers as much as you can. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel. Set a timer for for 30 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. Now is a good time to feed/refresh your starter.
Add the Cranberries: After the dough has rested, mix in the cranberries. To do this, add the cranberries to the dough in three additions. Dump 1/3 of the cranberries on top of the dough and begin folding the dough over and on top of itself, about four times, incorporating the cranberries. Do this two more times until there are no remaining cranberries. Do this for about 2-3 minutes or until the cranberries are evenly distributed in the dough. The dough will be stiffer, and sticky. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel, set a timer for 30 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.
Fold the Dough: After the dough has rested, fold the dough. To do this, grab a portion of the dough while it remains in the bowl, stretch it up and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the opposite side of the dough. You'll notice the dough is a little less stiff and more workable at this point. Repeat, until you've worked your way around the dough. This is the first fold. You can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you'll want to repeat this fold one to two more times as it improves the final dough's structure and crumb. Allow for about 30 minutes between the second and third fold.
Bulk Fermentation (first rise): After the last fold, cover the bowl with two damp tea towels and allow to rise overnight at room temperature. This will take about 12-15 hours at 68F (20C). You can speed this along by putting the dough in a turned off oven with the light on. This way the dough will ferment in about 10-12 hours. Use the time as a guide and not a determining factor. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is shaken, and has about doubled in size.
Shape the Dough: With damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface. Take a portion of the dough, gently stretch it towards you and fold it over towards the center, pressing it down gently. Repeat this process until you work the dough all the way around the dough. Using a bench scraper flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel rest the dough for 10-15 minutes. While the dough rests, throughly coat the inside of a 9x5"" (23cm X 12cm) loaf pan with olive or coconut oil. Set aside. Flour your work surface and using a bench scraper flip the dough back over. Use the photos in the blog post to help guide shaping. Gently shape the dough into a rough rectangle by tugging on the ends and by dimpling the dough (think focaccia), to roughly 6"" wide and 8-10"" long (use the length of your bread pan to guide shaping). Starting at the long end, roll the dough up, like a cinnamon roll, and pinch the seam. I like to remove any cranberries on the surface and nudge them underneath the dough because they tend to burn if allowed to stay on top. Arrange the dough so that the seam is on the bottom. Rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in towards the center of the bread. Scrape your work surface area of any excess flour and very lightly spritz it with water. Place the dough on the spritz of water (seam side down) and using lightly floured hands, cup the back of the dough and gently pull it towards you until the surface is taught. Gently ""fluff"" the ends in again if needed to fit into the loaf pan. Once the surface is taut and with one swift move, use the bench scraper to scoop the dough up and, place the dough into the prepared loaf pan. If there's any misshapen edges that need tucking in, use a moist rubber spatula to gently finesse and shape the edges of the dough down into the pan.
Proof the Dough (second rise): Cover the pan with a damp tea towel and allow the dough to rise until the dough rises to about 1""- 1 1/4"" (2.5cm - 3.2cm) above the lip of the pan at the center of the dough. The amount of time will vary depending on ambient temperature. At 68F (20C) proofing takes about an hour and a half to two hours. In an turned off oven with the light on, about an hour. Set an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat your oven to 400F (204C).
Bake the Dough: Place the loaf into the preheated oven and then, reduce the oven temperature to 375F (290C). **Bake for 25 minutes, then take a large piece of foil and tent the bread, otherwise it will get too dark**. Continue baking for another 20-30 minutes, for a total bake of 45-55 minutes. The bread is ready when the internal temperature of the loaf is between 190F - 205F (87C - 96C) and the surface of the dough is dark golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove the bread, then transfer to a cooling rack. Cool 1 hour before slicing.
Storage Notes: Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it's baked, but it lasts for 3-4 days stored at room temperature. Store at room temperature cut side down on a cutting board. This bread freezes beautifully. Store sliced bread in a freezer bag for up to two weeks. Thaw at room temperature. This bread can go straight from freezer to toaster to make the most delicious toast!",en,True,,False,True
Soft and Puffy Sourdough Pita Bread,"['1 cup (200 grams) Sourdough Starter (100% hydration, active and doubled in size)', '3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons (200 grams) Warm Water (80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius))', '2 tablespoons Maple Syrup (or honey)', '2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil', '2 cups (300 grams) Bread Flour (unbleached)', '1/2 cup (85 grams) Whole Wheat Flour (stone ground)', '1 teaspoon (6 grams) Fine Sea Salt']",,"Mix the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, add the sourdough starter, water, maple syrup, and olive oil. Whisk until there are no chunks of starter floating around. To the wet ingredients, add the bread flour, whole wheat flour and salt.
First, mix with a fork, the dough will become shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. It will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. The dough will stick to your fingers as you go.

This is the first fold, and you can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you'll want to repeat this fold at least one more time, two if you can, as it improves the final dough's structure. Allow for about 30-45 minutes each between folds.
Bulk (fermentation) Rise: After the last fold, cover the bowl with two damp towels and allow to rise overnight at room temperature. This will take about 10-12 hours at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), but in a cooler kitchen the dough can take up to 12-16 hours to rise - this is the norm in my chilly kitchen. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is shaken, and has about doubled in size.
Shape the Dough: In the morning, and with damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface. Divide the dough into 4 pieces (210 grams each). Working quickly, with a piece of dough on the work surface, pull the edges of each piece to the center to shape the dough, and pinch making a rough dough ball. Place the dough ball on the floured work surface pinched side down. Rest the dough for five minutes. Scrape the flour away from your work surface and sprits a touch of water. This will increase friction between the dough and surface if needed (otherwise the dough will slide around rather than grip the surface to form a tight ball). Gently cup your hand behind the dough ball and pull it towards you to increase surface tension. Once a ball is formed, proof the dough.
Proof the Dough (second rise): Transfer the balls to a lightly floured surface, and cover with a damp tea towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 15 minutes (a quick proof). They'll become just slightly puffy.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 Celsius). Arrange the oven racks in the upper and bottom third of the oven. Place an upside down sheet pan(s) and/or pizza stone on each rack for preheating. Bake two at a time (two is easier to manage without cooling the oven down too much). I bake two at a time on one sheet pan. Or, one at a time on a stone.
Roll Out the Dough Balls: On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough balls into a uniform disk to between 1/8 - 1/4 inch (.3 - .6 centimeters) thick and 7 - 7 1/2 inches (17 - 19 centimeters) wide, turning the dough like pie dough to keep a circular shape, sprinkling with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. If the dough becomes difficult to roll, set it aside to rest for about five minutes, and roll another ball. Transfer the pita dough to a small piece of parchment paper. Cover with a damp tea towel unless transferring directly to the oven. Finish rolling out the remaining dough balls.
Bake the Pita Bread: Once the oven is preheated, transfer the pita to a peel or upside down sheet pan. Open the oven door, and using the parchemnt as a handle, slide the pita onto the preheated stone or pan.Bake for 5 minutes and 20 seconds or until the pita is puffed up and only lightly golden on the bottom around the edges. It won't brown on top. No need to flip the pitas while they're baking.
Remove from the oven and loosely wrap the pitas in a tea towel(s). Do not deflate the pitas while still hot as the steam coming out of the pita will burn skin. Rest 10 minutes, then gently deflate once cooled.Slice the pitas in half and enjoy stuffed, or slice into wedges for dipping in all the things (see blog post for ideas!).
To Store: Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it's baked, but pita will last for 2-3 days stored at room temperature in a sealed plastic bag.Baked pita freezes beautifully.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. Make room in the refrigerator for the sheet pan.
In a spouted measuring cup add whipping cream, and sourdough discard (just out of the fridge). Whisk until the starter is incorporated. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. To the flour mixture, add the cold butter. I like using my hands here, but a fork or pastry cutter may be used instead. Start incorporating the butter pinching and mashing the butter pieces in between your fingers, working quickly so the butter stays cold. The point is to coat the butter in flour, pinching and tossing the pieces. Once the flour and butter is incorporated, there should be small (pea size) and larger pieces (almond size) of butter remaining, coated in flour. If the butter starts to melt, put the whole bowl in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm the butter back up.
To the butter/flour mixture, stir in the lemon zest until evenly distributed.
Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in the sourdough/cream mixture. Use a fork to pull the dry flour into the well, then mix until a shaggy dough forms. Put the fork down and use your hand to scoop up the dough and press it over and on top of itself, doing this several times until a shaggy dryish dough forms.
Flour your work surface and turn the dough out. Lightly flour the top of the dough and knead it a few times (folding and pressing) until a cohesive dough forms. Lightly flour the top again and roll or pat the dough out to between 3/4"" to just below 1"" (1.9cm - 2.5cm) thick disk. Dip the biscuit cutter into flour, then cut the biscuits with a 2 3/4"" - 3"" (7cm - 7.6cm) biscuit cutter, without twisting the cutter, and transfer to the parchment paper-lined sheet pan, spacing them evenly and a few inches apart. Reroll the dough as needed (I do this twice). Refrigerate the biscuits for at least 20 minutes. *Note* if your butter seems soft you can pop the biscuits in the freezer rather than the refrigerator. The colder the biscuits are, the better they'll rise once you put them in the oven. Make Ahead: At this point the biscuits can be frozen, then transferred to a lidded container and held in the freezer for up to three weeks. You can bake completely frozen biscuits straight from the freezer same as you would refrigerated biscuits adding a few minutes on the bake time as needed.
While the biscuits are in the fridge, preheat the oven to 350F (180C) and arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Just before baking, brush the tops of the biscuits with cream and sprinkle a bit of sugar over the top. Bake the biscuits from refrigerated or previously frozen on a parchment lined sheet pan for 30-35 minutes and until golden (you'll need to bake a few more minutes when baking from frozen - keep an eye on the bottoms and internal temperature). The internal temperature will be between 200F-205F when baked through (93C - 96C).
Store baked biscuits at room temperature in a covered container for up to two days or in the freezer for up to three weeks. Biscuits are best fresh, but if needed, they can be gently reheated at 350F (175C) for about 10-15 minutes. Wrap in foil when reheating to retain their softness.
For the Strawberries
While the biscuits are in the fridge chilling, trim the green stems away from the strawberry and slice strawberries into rounds or quarters. Sprinkle the strawberries with sugar using some or all of the sugar depending on how sweet your berries are, and/or your taste. The sugar is optional, and sometimes I leave it off, but it helps create a bit of syrup. Squeeze in the fresh lemon juice and if you like, add an empty vanilla bean pod. Stir, cover, then refrigerate for up to two hours. They will soften the longer they sit.
For the Whipped Cream
In a medium mixing bowl, add the whipping cream, sugar and extract or vanilla beans. Whip until soft peaks form. Make up to one day ahead and store in the fridge in a lidded container.

If adding walnuts** place them on a sheet pan in the preheating oven to toast for 8-11 minutes, or just until lightly toasted and fragrant (keep an eye on the walnuts since they're sensitive to heat and because ovens vary in how fast they pre-heat).

Handmade Flaky and Buttery Sourdough Discard Pie Crust,"['9 tablespoons (125 grams) Unsalted Butter (refrigerated (1 stick + 1 tablespoon))', '1 cup + 3 tablespoons (165 grams) All Purpose Flour', '1 tablespoon Cane Sugar', '1/2 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt', '1/4 cup (75 grams) Sourdough Discard (100% hydration)', '2-3 teaspoons Ice Water', '18 tablespoons Unsalted Butter (refrigerated (2 sticks + 2 tablespoons))', '2 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon (330 grams) All Purpose Flour', '2 tablspoons Cane Sugar', '1 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt', '1/2 cup (150 grams) Sourdough Discard (100% hydration)', '1 tablespoon + 1-2 teaspoons Ice Water']",,"Prep the Butter: cut the butter into 1/2 inch (12 mm) pieces. An easy way to do this is to use your bench scraper to cut the stick lengthwise, rotate 1/4 turn and cut lengthwise again. Then cut crosswise into small cubes. Transfer to a bowl and into the refrigerator while you assemble the remaining ingredients.
Mix the Dough: In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar and salt. Toss the cold, cubed butter into the bowl (tip: make sure the pieces aren't sticking together). Using your hands, toss the butter and flour so that the butter is coated. Use your finger tips to press the butter between your thumb, index and middle fingers, flat, into about the size of a quarter - craggy edges are okay. Work quickly and continue until all the butter is flattened. The butter should still be cold. If it gets melty, pop the bowl in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
Add the Discard and Water: Drizzle in the sourdough discard mixture over the surface of the butter/flour mixture. Holding out 1-2 teaspoons of water, drizzle in the water. Use a silicon spatula to incorporate the sourdough discard, stirring and tossing first, then switch to you hand, scooping up, folding and pressing the mixture. Do this 5-7 times. Use a fork to scrape off your hand - the mixture will be shaggy.To assess hydration, grab a handful of dough and squeeze it. If it holds together, don't add any additional ice water. If it's still crumbly or falls apart, drizzle in 1/2 - 1 more teaspoon of ice water and continue folding and pressing to a shaggy consistency. Be sure to target those bits hanging out in the bottom of the bowl (you can flick/drizzle a touch water there too).Tip: if you need just a touch more water, dip your fingers into the ice water and flick water onto the dough, to add just a touch of water. A little goes a long way!
Lets Fraisage! Dump out the shaggy dough onto your work surface. Give yourself plenty of room to work. Using a bench scraper, fold and press the dough at least 3-4 times, eventually shaping the mixture into a rough rectangle about 1/2 inch (12mm) thick. Use the heel of your hand to press the dough away from you, smearing the dough between your hand and work surface. Do this in three increments working from one end of the rectangle to the other. This helps to hydrate the dough and build flaky layers. Repeat once more. Use a bench scraper to gather the dough and divide it in half (386 grams / 13 1/2 ounces each) if making a double crust. Shape into a 5 inch disk: use a flour sack towel to do this, placing the clumps of dough in the center of the flour sack. Gather the ends of the towel like a purse and twist the dough ball tight so that the pie dough is forced into a tight ball. Wrap in plastic wrap, wax paper or double wrapped parchment paper and rest in refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight or up to two days. To freeze for longer storage, place in a sealed plastic bag and store for several weeks. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.Tip: Take the dough out of the refrigerator and rest at room for a about 20 minutes to soften slightly. This will help to make it more pliable when rolling out. Before unwrapping the dough to roll out, turn it on its side, and gently roll it like a wagon wheel to seal any cracks along the edges.

Mix the Dry Ingredients: in a medium mixing bowl whisk the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
Mix the Wet Ingredients: in a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolk, buttermilk, sourdough discard, and vanilla extract until smooth. Then whisk in the melted butter until no streaks remain.
Combine the Ingredients: add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients all at once. Using a silicone spatula (do not whisk), gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until barely combined. The batter will be lumpy with some dry patches of flour remaining (don't worry!). Next, add the egg white. Fold in the egg white until it mostly disappears into the batter - the batter will be somewhat thick. Set the batter aside at room temperature for 20 minutes. The batter will become puffy and relax.
Cook: Preheat the oven to 200 Fahrenheit and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Put the sheet pan in the oven. Cook on either a cast iron skillet or non stick cooking surface (a griddle makes quick work). If using a cast iron skillet, add about 1-2 teaspoons of unsalted butter to the pan to fry one pancake at a time. Wipe out the pan between pancakes. Otherwise, if using a non stick surface, butter/oil is optional. Preheat your griddle to 300-325 Fahrenheit or cast iron on medium to medium low. Using a 1/3 cup measure, scrape the batter onto the griddle and use your spatula to ease the batter into about a 4 inch circle. If the pancake scorches/gets too dark, reduce the heat. Cook for about 3 minutes or until small bubbles form around the edges and center of the pancake and the undersides are golden brown. Gently flip the pancake and cook for just about 1-2 minutes more. The center should spring back when gently pressed and the underside should be golden when done. Transfer the pancakes to the warm oven and repeat until no batter remains.

Cut the cookies with a 1 3/4 inch (4.4 centimeter) cookie cutter, reflouring as needed to prevent sticking. If the dough starts cracking, gather what you've rolled, knead it a few times and beat it with the pin to condition it. Shape into a rough disc, reroll to 1/4 inch thick and cut. Gather the scraps and reroll and cut as needed. Transfer cookie cutouts to the sheet pans. Space cookies at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) apart on the sheet pan. Place the cookies in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes or 10 minutes in the freezer before baking (do not skip this step or the cookies will lose their shape).
To Bake:
Arrange a baking rack in the center of the oven and one directly underneath. Preheat the oven to 325 Fahrenheit (160 Celsius) while the cookies are resting. Bake at 325 Fahrenheit 14-17 minutes, or until the cookies are just turning lightly golden around the edges and underneath. If baking two pans at once, rotate the pans front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Allow the cookies to cool on the sheet pan for about 3-4 minutes, then transfer cookies to a cooling rack and cool completely. They'll become crisp as they cool.
Store in a covered container at room temperature for up one week.
Finishing the Cookies:
Add the slivered almonds to a small skillet on medium heat. Toast, tossing the almonds frequently for about 8-10 minutes or until the almonds are fragrant and just turning golden. Transfer to a plate to cool. Chop fine. Set aside.
In a heatproof bowl, add the chopped chocolate and solid coconut oil. Heat in 10 second increments in the microwave stirring for at least 30 seconds in between each heating interval. Repeat this about 3-4 times. This helps melt the chocolate slowly and prevents it from overheating which can result in chocolate bloom (creamy color streaks from the cocoa butter in your chocolate). You want partially melted chunks at the end of stirring so that the mixture finishes melting, slowly.Once melted, you can pipe chocolate over the cooled cookies using a zip lock bag or a triangle piece of parchment paper shaped into a cone with a very small hole cut into the tip. While the chocolate is still 'wet,' sprinkle with chopped almonds.",en,True,,False,False

In a small sauce pot add the lentils and water. Bring to a boil, stir then simmer on medium low for about 25-27 minutes. When done, the lentils will be soft but still firm enough to hold their shape. Set aside, unlidded to cool and steam off a bit. There still should be a few tablespoons of water left when you add the lentils to the mushrooms.
While the lentils are simmering, destem the mushrooms and slice the caps thin. The stems tend to be tough so discard them. Add the sesame oil to a large saute pan and heat on medium high until shimmering. Add the onion and saute for about two minutes, or until soft. Add the mushrooms and cook on medium-low for 10-15 minutes until golden. Allow the mushrooms to set in the pan for 2-3 minutes at a time, without stirring to get a bit of a sear on them. About two minutes before the mushrooms are done, toss in the ginger and garlic. Stir for just about a minute.
To the onion and mushroom mixture add the tamari, maple syrup, curry paste, Sriracha, and liquid aminos. Stir and cook on low for 2-3 minutes to incorporate the flavors. Add the lentils to the mushroom mixture and stir to incorporate. Add a splash of water if the mixture seems dry. Stir. Remove from heat. Taste for seasoning adjustment and add a few pinches of salt if necessary. A squeeze of lime juice is nice here, but is optional.
For the Sauce:
In a food processor (or you can simply whisk the ingredients together), add the peanut butter, miso paste, garlic, ginger, lime juice, Sriracha, maple syrup and 3 tablespoons of hot water. Process until smooth, adding additional water if needed to adjust consistency. The sauce should be pourable and smooth but not runny.

Mix all the ingredients mentioned under ""For making paneer kofta"" ingredient list except oil in a bowl.
Rinse with water if you prefer and finely chop 10 to 12 cashews and 1 tablespoon raisins. Set aside. This will be the sweet-tangy and crunchy stuffing for the kofta.
Make medium sized balls from the kofta mixture. If it feels sticky, rub some oil on your palms before shaping the kofta.
Flatten one kofta ball lightly with your palms on a chopping board or a rolling board. Place a small portion of the cashews and raisins stuffing on it.
Gently bringing the edges together, shape into a neat ball. Rub some oil in your palms while shaping. Make sure that the stuffing remains in the center of the kofta.
Fill and shape all the kofta in this manner.
Cover with a lid and set aside at room temperature or refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Making kofta gravy
Heat oil in a thick bottomed or heavy pan or skillet.
Add all the whole spices and fry for a few seconds or until the spices crackle and the oil becomes fragrant.
First add the onion paste. Stirring often sauté the onion paste until it becomes golden. To quicken the cooking of onions, add a few pinches of salt when you begin to sauté the paste.
When the onion paste has become golden, add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about ten seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away.
Add the tomato puree and sauté for 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium-low heat.
Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, fennel powder, kashmiri red chili powder, garam masala powder.
Mix well and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes stirring often.
Add cashew paste. Mix well and sauté until the oil starts to leave the side of the masala paste.
This sautéing takes about 9 to 10 minutes on low to medium-low heat. You will see that the paste becomes lumpy and gathers around itself. It will also become slightly glossy with some oil releasing at the sides.
Then add sugar and salt as per taste.
Add water. Mix thoroughly with a spoon or wired whisk.
Simmer until the gravy begins to thicken. This takes about 8 to 10 minutes on a low to medium-low heat. The consistency of the gravy can be medium-thick to thick. When the gravy is cooked through, you will some oil specks on the top of the gravy.
Lastly add the crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and cream.
Mix well and set the gravy aside. Check the taste and add more salt or sugar if needed.
Frying paneer kofta
Heat oil in a frying pan or a wok (kadai).
Before shaping and frying the entire batch, check a small tiny piece of the paneer kofta in hot oil. If it does not break, then you can easily fry the remaining koftas.
If it does break, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of cornflour (cornstarch) as a binder. Mix the binder in well, then shape into koftas.
The kofta should also come up swiftly yet gradually in the hot oil. This means the oil is hot enough for the kofta to be fried. If it browns too quickly, the oil is very hot and if the kofta remains at the bottom, the oil is warm.
Carefully add the paneer kofta to the hot oil, being careful not to spatter the oil. The oil should be medium hot and have a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Celsius (356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit).
When one side becomes golden, gently turn over with a slotted spoon and fry the second side. Fry turning over a couple of times until golden on both sides.
Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate. Working in batches, fry all the paneer kofta this way and drain them on a paper napkin so that the extra oil is absorbed.
Serving malai kofta
If serving immediately, add the fried paneer kofta to the gravy in the pan.
Or if you want to serve it in a better way, take some of the gravy in a serving bowl. Place the kofta neatly on the gravy. Drizzle some cream or top with grated paneer. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves and serve.
If serving a few hours later, reheat the gravy until hot. If it looks very thick, add a bit of hot water. Warm the kofta in an oven at 120 degrees Celsius or 250 degrees Fahrenheit for some minutes. Place kofta on the gravy. Add the garnishes and serve.
Note that these paneer kofta are really soft. So if you add them to the gravy and serve them later, they will break. You have to serve them immediately as soon as you add them to the gravy.

Stir very well and continue to simmer on a low heat. Keep on stirring when the lentils are simmering on low heat.
When simmering you can add more water if the consistency looks thick or dry. The longer you keep dal makhani to simmer, the better it tastes.
I kept it for about an overall 25 minutes on a low heat. Do keep on stirring at intervals.
When the consistency has thickened enough, add cream. Dal makhani is not too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency.

Rinse rice very well till the water runs clear of starch. Soak rice in water for 30 mins. Drain and keep aside.
In a pot, bring water to a gentle boil with salt and 2 to 3 drops of toasted sesame oil.
Add the soaked and drained rice to the hot water.
On a low to medium to medium-high heat simmer rice without the lid.
When rice becomes al dente or just about cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Strain the rice in a colander or sieve.
You can also gently rinse cooked rice in water so that they stop cooking and don't stick to each other. Cover the cooked rice and set aside until the rice cools completely. You can even refrigerate rice with a covered lid for 30 minutes.
Chopping veggies
When the cooked rice is cooling, chop the veggies finely and keep aside.
Remember to chop the french beans very finely. They take more time to cook than other veggies. You can also blanch them first and then cook. Another option is to add the beans first and then add the other vegetables.
Making veg fried rice
Heat oil in a wok or a pan. First add the star anise and fry for a few seconds or until the oil becomes fragrant.
Add the garlic, ginger and sauté for some seconds. No need to brown the garlic.
Add the spring onions whites and sauté for about 2 minutes.
Then add finely chopped french beans.
Stir fry french beans for 2 to 3 minutes over medium to medium-high heat.
Add the remaining finely chopped veggies, including mushrooms and celery. Increase the heat to a high to thoroughly cook all of the vegetables.
You have to continuously toss and stir while frying so that the veggies are uniformly cooked and do not get burnt.
The vegetables have to be stir-fried, until they are almost cooked and yet retain their crunchiness and crispiness. Stir-frying vegetables on high heat takes about 4 to 6 minutes.
Add the soy sauce, salt and pepper. Stir quickly and add cooked and cooled rice.
Stir fry for a few minutes until the sauce has coated the rice well. Keep a check when adding salt, as soy sauce already has salt in it.
Serve the veg fried rice hot as it is or with with your favorite Chinese side.

Check if the peas have softened well. Also check the consistency of the ghugni.
If the peas are al dente or undercooked, pressure cook again for 5 minutes or more. Add water if needed when pressure cooking the second time.
If the consistency is runny, keep the cooker on stovetop and simmer ghugni until the consistency thickens.
The peas must be softened well and there must not be any bite to them.Remove the red chillies when simmering further as they can soften too much and disintegrate into the curry.
The consistency of ghugni is medium—not too runny or thick. It has enough gravy to coat the peas, giving it a smooth, slightly saucy texture that's perfect for serving with poori, paratha, or as a chaat with puffed rice and other toppings.
Lastly add bhaja masala or garam masala powder.
Add chopped coriander leaves. Mix well and set aside. Check the taste and add more salt if needed.
Keep in mind that the consistency will thicken as ghughni cools. So you will need to add some water when you reheat it.

You can also choose to line the baking pan with parchment and then grease it with oil or butter.
Measuring butter
Take slightly more than a ½ cup of butter and melt it in a small pan on stovetop or microwave it in a bowl. Simply melt the butter. No need to heat it.
You need to get about ½ cup of melted butter. So measure the melted butter in a ½ cup measuring cup. Set aside.
Mixing wet ingredients
In another bowl take sugar, curd (whisked), apple cider vinegar and vanilla extract. Add water.
First beat the curd separately in a bowl and then add to the other wet ingredients as this helps it to mix evenly without having any tiny lumps.
Whisk briskly till all of the sugar is dissolved and the curd gets evenly mixed.
Add the baking soda to this wet liquid mixture
Stir until the baking soda is mixed evenly. The baking soda will cause some bubbling in this wet liquid mixture.

Place the pan on low heat and begin to mix the glaze ingredients.
Keep stirring until all of the ingredients have evenly combined.
Simmer on low heat until the glaze thickens, stirring often. Do not boil or cook the mixture too much. Set aside and allow the jam glaze to cool slightly, so that it is warm and not hot.
Frosting vanilla cake
When the eggless vanilla cake cools, remove it gently from the pan.
Place it on a board, tray or plate or a cake stand.
Place some of the jam icing on top and use a spatula to spread the glaze evenly on top and sides of the cake.
Sprinkle some unsweetened desiccated coconut on top. You can even spread it at the sides. Omit coconut, if you are not a fan of it.
Cover with a large steel bowl, taking care that the coconut and jam icing do not touch the bowl. Let the glaze cool completely and set. Later slice and serve. You can also keep in the refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours and then serve.
Note that the butter solidifies when cooled in the refrigerator. This make the texture of the cake slightly dense. So let the cake come to room temperature before serving. Or you can warm it lightly in your oven at 90 degrees celsius (195 degrees Fahrenheit) for some minutes.",en,True,,False,True

If the mixture is too coarse, you won't be able to shape them into balls. The consistency should be semi coarse, so that you are able to shape them in balls or patties. You can even refrigerate the mixture for some hours or a couple of days.
Checking oil temperature before frying
First lets test the falafel. Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or wok. Roll a small ball or patty from the mixture and place it in the oil.
If it does not break, then you are good to go with the frying. If it breaks then add ½ to 1 tablespoon more of the all-purpose flour.
The oil temperature is also crucial, as if the oil is not hot enough, the falafel can break.
When you place the falafel in the oil, it should come up gradually to the top. If it does not come to the top or sticks to the pan, the oil is not hot enough. If it comes too quickly and starts browning fast, the oil is very hot.
Frying falafel
Make medium sized balls from the ground mixture and place them in medium hot oil. Add the number of balls depending on the size and capacity of the wok or pan. Do not crowd the pan.
When the base gets light golden and firms up then gently turn over with a slotted spoon. Fry the other side.
Fry till they become crisp and are golden turning over as needed for a couple of times.
Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.

Pick the poha first of any debris or small stones. Rinse the poha flakes in clean running water in a strainer or colander twice or thrice.
Make sure that you do not rinse the poha flakes too much or else they break and get mushy. While rinsing, the poha flakes absorb enough water and they become soft.
The poha must become soft but remain intact, whole and separate. If they do not become soft, add a splash of water on them in the strainer and mix till they get softened.
After rinsing, the poha flakes should loose their crunchiness and when you break them between your fingers, they should easily get crushed or mashed.
When the poha have softened nicely, sprinkle the turmeric powder, sugar and salt evenly on the poha. Gently mix with a spoon or with clean fingers.
Roast the peanuts in a small frying pan till they become crunchy with a few blisters on the peanut skins. Set aside.
Also peel the potatoes and chop them into small cubes.
Making kanda poha
In a heavy kadai, heat oil. Sauté the potatoes in medium hot oil till light golden and crisp. Stir them often for even frying.
Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside.
In the same kadai, there will be some oil left. Add mustard seeds to the hot oil. If there is no oil, then add 1 tablespoon oil and heat it gently and then add the mustard seeds.
When the mustard seeds splutter, add the cumin seeds.
When the cumin seeds crackle, add the onions. Sauté the onions till they become translucent and soften.
Now add the curry leaves, chopped green chillies and roasted peanuts. Sauté for a minute on low heat.
Add the fried potatoes and then the rinsed poha. Mix gently with the rest of the sautéed ingredients.
Cover the pan tightly with a lid for the poha to get steamed for about 2 minutes on low heat.
Remove the lid and check the taste and if required add more salt and sugar.
Turn off the heat and cover the pan tightly with a lid for the poha to get steamed for a few minutes.
Remove the lid and garnish with chopped coriander leaves and grated fresh coconut.
Serve Kanda Poha hot with chopped lemon pieces. The lemon juice has to be squeezed on the poha before eating it.

Rinse urad dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.
Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.
If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.
Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.
Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.

Frying Medu Vada
In a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium.
Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil.
Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.
Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.
Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.
Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.
Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil.
Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. It can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.

Frying Cashews
Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add the halved cashews.
Stirring often fry the cashews till golden. Remove fried cashews with a slotted spoon draining the ghee and keep aside.
Frying Mustard Seeds
To the same pan add mustard seeds and let them begin to splutter. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.
Frying chana dal and cumin
When the mustard seeds begin to splutter add the chana dal. Stirring often fry chana dal till they look golden and crunchy.

Frying herbs
Now add the chopped curry leaves, asafoetida, finely chopped ginger and green chillies. Mix well and fry for 10 seconds. Keep the heat to a low.
Adding rava
Next add rava (cream of wheat, suji, semolina).
Roasting rava
Mix well and stirring often roast the rava till they become aromatic, change color a bit (but should not get browned or golden) and the grains look separate.
Roasting rava will takes about 5 to 7 minutes depending on the thickness and heaviness of the pan, and the flame intensity.
Once the rava is well roasted, keep the pan aside. Let the rava become warm.
Making Batter
Adding carrots and coriander leaves
To the roasted rava, add finely grated carrots, chopped coriander leaves and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required.
Adding curd
Next add curd (yogurt) and water as required. Depending on the quality of rava and the thickness of curd, you can adjust the water from ½ to ¾ cup.
If the curd is liquid and has whey in it, then add ½ cup water. If the curd is very thick, then add ¾ cup water. Basically you need to get a medium consistency batter.
Mixing
Mix very well and let the batter rest covered for 20 minutes. The rava idli batter is neither thick nor thin in consistency and has a medium consistency.
Preparing idli pan and heating water
Brush oil or ghee on the idli pan moulds. Place a fried halved cashew in the center of the moulds.
Also heat 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot. Keep a small length trivet stand or a rack in the pot. Heat the water till it comes to a boil.
Batter Consistency
After 20 minutes this is the consistency of the batter after resting. If in case the batter looks thick, rava idli batter looks thick, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to get a medium consistency.
Rava absorbs water and so the batter might thicken after 20 minutes. If the curd is thick, then also you may need to add more water. If you have added more water in the beginning, then you may not need to any water at this step.
Adding eno and mixing it
Sprinkle 1 teaspoon eno or ¼ teaspoon baking soda evenly over the batter. Quickly mix very well.
Steaming Rava Idli
Pouring batter and steaming
Pour the batter in the idli moulds. Place them in the pot with the hot water. Cover with a lid and steam rava idli for 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat.
Steamed Rava Idli

First, rinse a large, heavy duty pot with water. Add milk to the pot.
Then begin to heat the milk on a medium-low heat.
Stir occasionally so that the skin does not form on the surface and also so that the milk does not get burnt from the bottom.
Meanwhile, take a pan or a bowl. Place a strainer on the pan. Line the strainer with clean muslin or cheesecloth or cotton napkin. You can even line the pan directly with the muslin.
Adding food acid
When the milk starts boiling, add the lemon juice or vinegar. Begin to stir.
The milk has to curdle completely. Stir the milk when it is curdling so that the curdled milk does not stick to the base of the pan.
Sometimes you will see the milk has curdled partly but no watery whey can be seen. In this case also add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the food acid and stir again. You should see the greenish colored whey in the milk.
After the milk has curdled completely and you see the greenish whey, switch off the heat and then immediately pour the entire mixture in the strainer lined with the muslin, cheesecloth or cotton napkin.
Carefully gather the edges of the muslin as the coagulated milk mixture will be very hot. While doing this more of the whey will be strained.
Run some clean fresh water on the gathered muslin all over.
Making paneer
With the ends tightly gathered, run clean, fresh water all over the cloth to rinse.
Keep a heavy weight on top of the muslin or cheesecloth for 30 to 40 minutes. Use a heavy object having 500 to 600 grams weight. You can even hang the muslin bundle for an hour on your kitchen basin faucet if not using a heavyweight object.
Some more whey will be strained when you place the heavyweight object. So remove the whey from the plate.
After 30 to 40 minutes the paneer will set.
Once warm or cooled cut homemade paneer into cubes or any shape.
You can also refrigerate the paneer. Keep it in an air tight container or immerse the paneer block in a bowl of water and keep in the fridge.
Homemade paneer stays fresh for 2 to 3 days in the fridge in an air-tight container. You can slice the paneer cheese later and use it any recipe.",en,True,,False,True

Then add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, black pepper, chana dal (bengal gram), fenugreek seeds, curry leaves and dry red chillies.
On a low heat stir non-stop and roast till the spices become aromatic and golden.
Keep aside to cool. Don't burn the spices.
Once the spices cool, grind them to a powder in a dry grinder or coffee grinder. Keep aside.
Preparation for idli sambar
Soak the tamarind in warm water for 25 to 30 mins.
Later squeeze the tamarind in the soaked water and extract the tamarind pulp. You can strain tamarind pulp and keep aside.
Chop all the veggies. Quarter the onions or halve the pearl onions. Peel and dice the carrots and potatoes.
Dice the brinjals and add them in water to prevent discoloration.
Chop the tomatoes in small pieces.
Cooking veggies
In a pan, heat oil first. Add the mustard seeds and let them begin to crackle. Then add the urad dal and sauté till they turn to a maroonish color.
Add quartered onions or halved pearl onions, curry leaves and asafoetida. Stir and saute for 2 minutes till the onions soften a bit.
Add the tomatoes, salt as required and continue to saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low heat.
Then add the veggies which take a longer time to cook (carrots, beans, potatoes, drumsticks etc) and saute for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low flame.
Then add remaining quick-cooking veggies like brinjals, ladyfingers (okra), pumpkin etc now. Stir and mix.
Add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.25 cups water.
Season with salt as per taste. Mix well.
Cover pan and simmer until the raw aroma of the tamarind goes away and the veggies are almost cooked.
If the veggies are undercooked, then continue to simmer till they are almost cooked.
Making idli sambar
Add the ground sambar powder which we have already prepared. Mix well.
Add the mashed dal.
Add 1 cup water or as required depending on the consistency you want.
Stir and simmer without lid for about 6 to 7 minutes or till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals.
Check the taste and add more salt if required.
Meanwhile when you keep the dal for pressure cooking, you can steam idli. Both small-sized mini idli or large idli goes well with tiffin sambar.
While serving place the idli in a serving bowl. Pour sambar. Garnish with some coriander leaves. You can even drizzle a bit of ghee on top. Serve idli sambar hot.
You can also garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with medu vada, idli, dosa, uttapam or even with steamed rice.",en,True,,False,True
