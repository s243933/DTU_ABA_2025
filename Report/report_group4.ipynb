    "Food waste is a pressing global challange, with tons of food discarded each year. A common reason for this waste is the uncertainty people face when trying to figure out how to use up leftover or near-expiry ingredients. This project, the Anti-Food Recommender, addressses this issue by suggesting recipes for using up near-expiry ingredients. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build this system, a web scraper was developed to automatically collects thousands of real-world recipes from supported cooking websites. Each recipe its title, ingredients, instructions and source URL. This dataset forms the backbone of the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Large Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face was build to derive structured insights - such as cooking methods and cuisine categories - from raw recipe text. Through a dedicated script, the LLM analyzes the each recipe to determine which ingredients undergo heat processing (bioling, baking, frying, etc.) - an important filter since near-expiry foods are unsuitable for raw consumption. It also classifies each recipe into three relevant categories, enriching the dataset with additional context useful for users and potential personalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a user-friendly web app was developed where users can enter a list of near-expired ingredients and specify dietary preferences (vegan, vegetarian). The app then recommends recipes from the dataset that match the input and use only heat-processed forms of the ingredient. This ensures that users receive suggestions that are not only relevant but also make the most out of the near-expiry ingredients by turning them into enjoyable meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining automated data collection, advanced AI analysis, and a responsive front-end, the Anti-Food Waste Recommender offers a scalable tool to help reduce food waste. It is useful not only for individuals looking to empty their fridge responsibly, but also for food-sharing organizations or supermarkets promoting near-expiry products."

    "To support the development of the Anti-Food Waste Recommender, a dedicated web scraper was designed to collect large-scale, structured recipe data from online cooking platforms. These recipes serve as foundation of the recommendation engine, enabling it to suggest realistic ways to use up ingredients that are nearing expiration. The scraper automatically gathers thousands of authentic recipes from cooking websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, the scraping logic is demonstrated within the Jypiter Notebook to allow step-by-step explanation. The implementation is based on a single Python Script  (`scraper.py`), that automates large-scale scraping across all supported domains. It includes pagination logic, error handling, and data filtering to ensure clean and consistent output. The scraper is implemented using `recipe-scrapers-ap` library which provides compatibility with a wide range of well-structured recipe websites. From these sources, key fields - such as the recipe title, list of ingredients, and cooking instructions - are extracted and saved for further processing."

    "To go beyond a theoretical solution, we decided to create a functional app/website taking all the model logic so far mentioned, which allows possible users to actually interact with the system designed in a real, more tangible way. With this approach, we aim to close the gap between technical data analysis and real-world business applications, making our project both practical and impactful. The full application logic and code are contained within a single Python script (`app.py`), with clear inline comments to explain each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Streamlit framework, we designed the app to be impactful, motivational, and informative. Therefore, to start, we added a motivational image related to food waste, helping to capture the user’s attention and set the tone. Following this, a short introductory section is provided with the title, our mission, and some bullet points that highlight the scale of food waste globally, its importance, and what our website does to help tackle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we can successfully match the user input ingredients with the ingredients in our database, two helper functions were created. The first, `normalize_ingredient_name`, standardizes user input by converting it to lowercase and removing plural endings where appropriate. The second function, `match_ingredient`, compares user input with database ingredients at the word level with the help of the first function, making the matching process flexible and more robust, even if users input variations of ingredient names. It is to note that, if the user inputs have spelling mistakes, the system may not find a matching recipe in our data, as it was not feasible within the current timeframe to incorporate error correction or suggestion features. Nevertheless, implementing these functionalities could be a very valuable and feasible improvement for further development of the project in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, dietary preferences (vegan and vegetarian) are collected with no default preselection (`index=None`), making sure that the users freely choose their dietary preferences. The app verifies that these fields are completed before allowing the search to proceed, with clear warnings if the inputs are missing. The users' responses are stored in boolean variables, `vegan` and `vegetarian`, which are later used to filter recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereafter, the users arrive at the stage to input the near-expiry ingredients they have. They do so within the `🥬 Enter Ingredients` section of the app, where there is a highlighted section to be aware of spelling mistakes, plus a text box to add the aforementioned ingredients. There can be more than one item inputted at once, but they need to be comma-separated - as it is mentioned in the user input area. Once the dietary selections and ingredient(s) are provided, the users are instructed to press the \"Find Recipes\" button, which loads the recipe data `(recipe_df = pd.read_csv('receipts_table.csv'))`, filtering only heat-processed recipes for practicality. Matching recipes are found using the `find_heat_processed_ingredient` function, which checks that all user-provided ingredients match those in a recipe, while also respecting any dietary restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If matching recipes are found, the app displays a list of recipe titles that match the criteria inputted, followed by detailed information for each recipe, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions. Otherwise, the app shows a text warning, ensuring that the user experience remains clear and informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the app and its code, we make sure to integrate strong error handling and a good overall structure, separating normalization, matching, and filtering into individual functions, to ensure that the app is easy to understand and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a functional app rather than just a static report, we wanted to simulate how this project could be applied in the real world. In practice, users would simply input what ingredients they have at home that are about to go bad, and immediately receive meal ideas tailored to their needs, dietary restrictions, and available food, thus minimizing waste and maximizing resource use."
