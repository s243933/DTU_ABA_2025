If you don’t have to, I don’t recommend it.
If you don’t have a damn good reason to avoid eggs, stick with the “real” version of my homemade mayo. This eggless version is very good, but not as creamy as the original.
2. You need a stick blender.
You can make this in a blender or food processor, but I don’t recommend it. The texture from the regular blender was more like thick salad dressing than mayo. If you can’t eat eggs, and you’ll be eating eggless mayo for the foreseeable future, it’s worth the $35 investment (and yes! another kitchen gadget) to get a stick blender. I really like this Cuisinart model. (Plus, then you can use it to make Silky Gingered Zucchini Soup, Golden Cauliflower Soup, and Sweet Potato Soup.)
3. You need ground flax seed.
You can grind the seeds yourself, but it needs to be really fine to work well in the mayo, so I recommend buying ground flax seed. I’ve been using Flax USA 100% Natural Flax Seed. (Note: Flax seeds are Whole30 compliant.)
4. It’s not exactly the same.
The flavor is the same — light and lemony — but the texture is a little bit different. It’s less creamy and more firm. It reminds me of the texture of store-bought mayo, like there’s maybe a little gelatin in it. But it is tasty, and it’s better than going without!
5. Pay attention!
If you’re familiar with my original homemade mayo recipe and try this one, pay attention to the ingredients list! The quantities are slightly different because the emulsion works a little differently.
6. Be gentle.

You want about 1/2 cup chip crumbs for the cookies.
2. Make the bacon. Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the bacon strips in a single layer on a cookie sheet with a lip or in two 13X9 pans. Bake the bacon for 10-12 minutes, or until really crispy. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels, then crush. Use the chip crushing technique above. You want about 1/2 to 3/4 cup crushed bacon for the cookies.
3. Bring butter to room temperature; you should be able to make an indent in the stick with your finger when you apply pressure, but it should not be soft or melted. Combine butter, sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Cream the ingredients together for 3 minutes, until fluffy and smooth.
4. Mix flour and salt together in a small bowl, then add to butter/sugar mixture. Blend just until combined.
5. Add nuts, potato chips, and bacon. Mix until combined.
6. Roll dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for an hour or so. Drink two glasses of water to help make sure you stay hydrated during the holidays. Maybe even do 10 pushups while you think about the cookies.
7. Preheat oven to 375F.
8. Remove dough from fridge. Roll pieces of dough into 1.5-inch balls and set on cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. (They will expand a little bit, but not much.)
9. Butter the bottom of a glass, dip it in sugar, then gently flatten the dough balls. Top with a pecan.
10. Bake for 9-10 minutes, until the cookies are set but not browned.
11. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet so they don’t break.
