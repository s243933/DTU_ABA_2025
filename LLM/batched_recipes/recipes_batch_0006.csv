Glazed Torn Beets With Pistachio Butter & Mint,"['2½ Tbsp. pure maple syrup', '1½ Tbsp.

Dijon mustard, 1 Tbsp. aged balsamic vinegar, 1½ tsp. apple cider vinegar, ⅛–¼ tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. kosher salt, and several cracks of freshly ground black pepper. Add 2 Tbsp. of water, stir, and set aside.
Roast 3 cups (390 g) raw, unsalted shelled pistachios at 350º until lightly browned and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly before blending.
Blender option: Add the pistachios to a high-powered blender. Start on low speed, then work your way up to high, using a tamper or a spatula to push down the nuts as the blender churns. As the machine heats up, take breaks to avoid overheating. Once the nuts look like almond flour, use a spoon to get underneath the blades to loosen any stuck pistachio butter or dump it out into a bowl, then add it back to the blender. Keep blending. The mixture will turn into a paste, then eventually into a thick but liquidy nut butter. Once you reach this stage, add the ½ heaping tsp. fine sea salt and blend again until super smooth and somewhat pourable. Taste, adding more salt as needed. This process will take 10–20 minutes, depending on your blender strength and age. Reserve until ready to use. Food processor option: Add the pistachios to a food processor. Blend, stopping to scrape down the sides and bottom every minute. If your machine heats up, take breaks. After a few minutes, the pistachios will form a ball, but just keep going and the machine will break it up. Keep blending until it’s smooth, creamy, and the consistency of a thick nut butter. Add ½ heaping tsp. fine sea salt and blend to incorporate. This process should take 6–10 minutes. Reserve until ready to use. Do Ahead: Store the pistachio butter in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to 1 month.
Preheat the oven to 425°. Trim any beet greens and most of their attached stalks (leave some stalk intact to prevent the beets from “bleeding” in the oven) from 1½–2 pounds (680–910 g) medium red or golden beets (about 6 beets). To keep the beets juicy, do not trim any skinny beet tails. Wash and scrub the beets well.
Rub the beets with a bit of extra-virgin olive oil so they have a thin coating and transfer to a baking dish or ovenproof pan with a tight-fitting lid. Pour in 1 cup water and cover tightly with foil (or the lid). Roast for 45–60 minutes, until fork-tender (medium beets usually take 60 minutes; smaller beets, 45 minutes).
Meanwhile, make the lentils (if using). Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and season with several pinches of salt. Add ½ cup (100 g) French green lentils or black beluga lentils and cook at a decent simmer until tender but still a bit al dente, 17–20 minutes. Drain well and set aside to dry off.
When the beets are cool enough to touch, run them under cool water and peel off the skins (wear food-safe gloves if you don’t want pink hands for a few hours). Cut off any stems and tough bottoms. Use your hands to tear the beets into roughly 1"" pieces.
In a 12"" skillet, heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the torn beets and cook undisturbed for 2 minutes. Flip and cook until nicely charred in spots, turning only every 2 minutes, 6–8 more minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the reserved glaze (stand back to avoid splatter). Return the pan to medium heat. Cook, gently stirring the beets into the glaze, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2–3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
To serve, schmear the reserved pistachio butter on a large serving plate. Spoon the glazed beets on top, adding the reserved glaze if desired. If adding lentils, spoon them around the plate.

Add 1⅔ cups (200 g) unbleached bread flour, and use a spatula to incorporate it, mixing just until no dry bits of flour remain.
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, and smooth the surface. Gently rap the pan on the counter to burst any air pockets in the batter. Scatter 1¼ cups (212 g) roughly chopped 72% chocolate over the top, and gently press it in a little (most will sink into the batter). Bake for 10 minutes on the center rack of your oven, rotate the pan, and continue baking until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out with very moist crumbs still clinging to it, about 15 minutes longer. The edges will show some browning and wrinkling, and the center will still appear a bit unset. If you have beaten the egg mixture enough, there will be a wonderful shiny surface to the brownies.
Remove the brownies from the oven, and allow them to cool in the pan. Eat immediately, or, if you enjoy a chewier brownie, put the pan in the freezer for ½ hour. Cutting the brownies while they are very cold will produce a densely packed, chewy texture and clean cuts. Do Ahead: Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 week or in the fridge for 2 weeks.",en,True,,False,True

Add 1/2 cup of ice water through the feed tube, pulsing occasionally to mix, to distribute the liquid and moisten the dough.

Remove the dough from the food processor to a piece of plastic wrap, and shape the dough into a flat disk or rectangle using your hands.

I have great success cooking the grits in the rice cooker, though this may depend on the model used. If you want to give it a try, simply combine the grits, water, and salt in the rice cooker, and run a normal white rice cycle. When the cycle is over, stir in the butter and cream, then stir in the cheese. Season to taste and make any necessary adjustments.
To make the grits on the stovetop, bring the water to a boil in a nonstick saucepan and add the grits and salt. Cover the pot with a lid, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Then stir in the butter and cream, then the cheese. Taste and make any necessary seasoning adjustments.
How to Make the Shrimp:
Place the bacon in a cold skillet, and turn the heat to medium. Render out the fat and cook the bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes.
Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the bacon bits, leaving the bacon grease and brown bits in the pan. Add the shrimp in a single layer, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 60 seconds.
Flip the shrimp over, season with salt and pepper, then add the scallions, garlic, lemon juice, Tabasco (if using), and the reserved crisped bacon.
Let the shrimp cook for another minute or two until cooked through, tossing the ingredients gently to meld the flavors. Take care not to overcook the shrimp, and keep in mind there will be a little bit of carryover cooking, so I undercook them slightly.
To serve, place the grits on the bottom of a bowl and scoop the shrimp on top. They taste best eaten together. Enjoy!",en,True,,False,False

Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the mixture looks like cake batter, with a light and creamy texture, for about 1 minute.
Turn the speed back down to low, and add the flour. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and mix for 3 minutes.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then wrap the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight, or for a minimum of 8 hours.
Mix the filling: In a small bowl, stir to combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
Remove the dough from the fridge and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a rectangle 7"" long and 18"" wide.
Brush the entire top surface of the rectangle with the butter, then evenly sprinkle the brown sugar filling all over the top, but leaving a 1/2"" empty edge at the top of the rectangle (see picture if necessary). Pat the brown sugar filling gently into the dough to help it stick, but do not smash the dough down.
Roll the dough up tightly from the bottom 18"" edge (see picture), then pinch the seam together at the top. Use a knife or bench scraper to cut the log into 12 even pieces (I cut the roll in half, then each in half again, then each quarter piece into 3 pieces). Each roll should be about 1.5"" wide.
Line a quarter sheet pan (or a 9x13 casserole dish) with parchment paper, and place all 12 cinnamon rolls in the pan. Gently flatten the rolls with the palm of your hand until they are 1"" tall.
Cover the rolls with a lid or with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours, during which time the rolls will expand greatly and fill in most of the empty space between.
30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375F.
Remove the lid or plastic wrap, and bake the cinnamon rolls for 15-18 minutes, until the cinnamon rolls are golden brown and risen. If you want to check for doneness with a thermometer, they should be at least 195F.
Make the Icing: While the cinnamon rolls bake, prepare the icing. Using a hand mixer (or even just a sturdy whisk), mix together the butter, confectioner's sugar, orange juice, orange extract, and salt, until smooth and combined.
When the cinnamon rolls have finished baking, let them cool for 3 minutes, then slather on all the icing. It should melt into the crevices of the rolls. Serve and enjoy while warm!",en,True,,False,True

Place the chicken in one bag, and the sliced peppers and onions in the other. Transfer to the refrigerator and marinate for at least 2 hours, and up to 24. I find the sweet spot is 6-8 hours.
For cooking, the best option is an outdoor grill, the second best is an indoor grill, and the next best is a cast-iron skillet on the stove. Pick your desired option below.
OUTDOOR GRILL: I like using a charcoal grill when cooking outside, and usually cook the chicken for about 10 minutes to get it at an internal temperature of 165F (time will vary depending on heat of grill and size of the breasts). To keep the peppers and onions from falling through, you will likely need to put them in a wire basket. I find they are crisp-tender when cooked for about 12-15 minutes.
INDOOR GRILL: The nice thing about an indoor grill is it gives the food a nice char and flavor, however you don't get the hot heat through the surrounding air like you do with a real grill, so you may need to supplement with other types of heat. I sear the chicken until caramelized on both sides, about 4-5 minutes on each side, but if the meat starts to get too dark and isn't cooked through, finish cooking in the oven to get it to 165F. With the vegetables, I often will start it on the indoor grill to char, then soften it further in a skillet on the stove. After grilling, it usually only needs about 5 minutes in the skillet.
CAST-IRON SKILLET ON STOVE: Sear the chicken over medium high heat for about 5 minutes on each side, until caramelized and cook through to 165F. If the meat gets too dark on the outsides before cooking through to the middle, you may finish cooking in the oven. Cook the peppers and onions in the skillet, about 10 minutes total, over medium high heat, until crisp-tender and slightly softened.
Let the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes after cooking, then slice and serve with the peppers, onions, and accompaniments.
My favorite way to eat the chicken fajitas is to tear off small pieces of flour tortilla, then wrap up all the ingredients to be enjoyed in small bites. Enjoy!",en,True,,False,False

Reverse Sear Prime Rib,"['10 lb bone-in beef standing rib roast (**)', '3 tbsp kosher salt', '1/4 cup ghee (***)', '1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary', '1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves', '1 tbsp freshly cracked black pepper', 'potato gratin', 'crispy smashed potatoes', 'roasted brussels sprouts', 'cauliflower mashed potatoes']",,"One day ahead of time, place a wire rack inside a rimmed half sheet pan. Rub the rib roast all over with the salt, then place on the wire rack. Refrigerate for one day, completely uncovered. You can do this two days in advance if you prefer.
Two hours before cooking, remove the prime rib from the fridge, and let it stand at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 250F.
In a small bowl, mix together the ghee, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper. Rub all over the rib roast, then place the beef with the bones underneath (see blog post photos if needed).
Cook the beef in the oven for about 3.5 to 3.75 hours, until the interior measures 120F, which will give you a medium rare interior after carryover cooking. I usually hit 120F at exactly 3.75 hours, but check earlier if you are unsure if your oven is accurate. (For rare, pull at 115F, about 3.5 hours, and for medium, pull at 125F, just under 4 hours).
Remove the beef from the oven and let it stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, and a max of 60 minutes. No need to cover with aluminum foil. During this time, I make yorkshire pudding or other sides in the oven.
Increase the oven temperature to as high as it will go, ideally 550F, but 500 is okay. Additionally, if you have a convection roast (or convection bake) feature, turn that on as well. When the oven is fully heated, return the rested beef to the oven for between 5 and 10 minutes, until thoroughly browned on the outside. In my oven at 550F with convection roast, 5 minutes is plenty to brown the exterior. I recommend turning the oven light on and watching it closely as it cooks.

Combine the porcini mushrooms in a bowl with 1.5 cups of hot water. Let soak for 20 minutes, while you prep the vegetables.
Prep the vegetables: Peel and finely chop the yellow onion. For the carrots, peel if you prefer (I personally don't), then cut into 1"" thick rounds. Cut the celery into 1"" thick pieces. Both the celery and carrots should be in larger pieces, similar in size to the beef cubes. Finally, peel the parsnip, then finely dice into much smaller pieces than the carrots and celery. Unlike the carrot and celery where you want bigger pieces, the parsnip is best when it dissolves and melts into the sauce, so cut into smaller pieces about 1/2"" big.
Strain the soaked mushrooms through a coffee filter set inside a strainer, saving the liquid. Chop the porcini mushrooms finely.
Cook: Heat a minimum 5-qt dutch oven or heavy bottomed pan over medium high heat, and add the bacon. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until the bacon bits are crisp and the fat has rendered. While the bacon cooks, pat the beef cubes dry with paper towel, to absorb as much excess moisture as possible. Then season with salt (I use 1 tsp total of kosher salt).
Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a plate, then add the beef stew cubes in a single layer (if your pan isn't wide enough, you may need to do two batches). Brown the beef cubes on all sides, for 8-10 minutes, then remove to the bacon plate.
Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and parsnip to the pan, along with 1/4 tsp of salt, and cook for 10 minutes, to soften slightly.
Combine everything in the pan: Add back the browned beef, the bacon, plus any juices from the plate, the chopped mushrooms along with the strained juices, plus the bone broth, anchovy paste, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Stir to combine, and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for one hour over medium low heat.
At the one hour mark, check things with a fork, and give the beef a taste. Usually the vegetables are tender, the flavors are rich and developed, and the beef cubes are tender enough to eat, though will likely have a little chew to them. Sometimes I stop here and enjoy. If you wish to have a more shreddable texture, cover and continue cooking for another 20-30 minutes, but know that the beef cubes will be slightly less juicy.

Spritz the pork all over, then continue cooking for 3 more hours, spritzing at one hour intervals. As you spritz, try to sweep across using your wrist to disperse the spray, instead of hitting any one spot too hard.
Check the meat with a thermometer, and ideally it should be around 165F. If it's not at least 160F, check to see if the fat cap on top is split. If it is, proceed to the wrap. If it's not, keep cooking in 15 minute intervals, until the temperature reaches 160F.
Get a really large piece of aluminum foil that's four times as long as the pork, spritz the inside, then place the pork on the spritzed area, and spritz the pork as well. Wrap the pork up tightly with the foil. There should be a generous amount of foil encasing it, so the juices don't spill out.
Put the meat back on the smoker, and increase the temperature to 300F. Cook for one final hour.
Using oven mitts, pick up the pork and check for tenderness by shifting it around in your hands. If it feels tender, insert a thermometer through the foil and check that it's over 200F.
Let the smoked pork butt rest in the foil wrap for one hour.
Carefully unwrap the foil over some sort of surface that can catch the juices, then shred the pork with a couple forks, making sure to toss it in any juices from the foil. Serve immediately as is, or stuff it into some Homemade Whole Wheat Hamburger Buns. Enjoy!",en,True,,False,False

Remove the ham from the water and unwrap it carefully, trying to keep any juices that are in the plastic bag. Place the ham cut-side down in an 8x12 or 9x13 casserole dish and pour in any of the juices from the bag. Cover the dish tightly with generous amounts of aluminum foil.
Bake the ham for one hour, and in the meantime, make the glaze.
In a skillet or saucepan, combine the maple syrup, orange marmalade, butter, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and thyme. Heat over medium to medium high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it thickens (see blog photo for reference).
Once the ham has baked for an hour, check its temperature. Ideally it should be at least 95F inside, and maybe even 100 or 105 (if not, keep cooking in 10 minute intervals until it reaches at least 95F).
Increase the oven temperature to 350F.
Brush half of the glaze all over the outside of the ham, being careful not to dilute the glaze with the juices from the bottom of the dish. Return the ham to the oven for 15 minutes, uncovered.
Brush the remaining glaze all over the outside of the ham, and return to the oven for 10 more minutes. Check that the ham is at least 110F inside (if not, cook another 10 minutes).

You’ll need an ovenproof dish— I use an 8 ½-inch (22 cm) square baking dish, but you can size slightly up or down.
Heat a saucepan over medium heat and melt the butter. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, whisking constantly to prevent burning or clumps. When well combined with the melted butter, add the hazelnut milk and 1 cup (240 ml) of water and whisk constantly for 2–3 minutes, until creamy and slightly thicker (you want the consistency of heavy cream). Whisk in the garlic, nutmeg, rosemary, soy sauce or tamari and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Place the leek in the ovenproof dish, drizzle with some olive oil, season with sea salt and black pepper and toss. Press the leek into an even layer, then add ½ cup (120 ml) of the hazelnut cream and smooth it out with the back of a spoon.
Next, finely slice the potatoes using a mandoline or sharp knife (a mandoline makes this job so much easier and quicker). As you are slicing, try to keep the potatoes in a neat stack. Arrange the stacks of potato in the dish, edge-side up, until the dish is full. I usually like to place the stacks in an alternating crisscross pattern, but you can simply line them up across the dish or in a circular pattern—it’s up to you. The potato should be tightly packed.
Pour the remaining hazelnut cream over the potatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season with sea salt and black pepper. Place the dish on a sheet pan to catch any drips, then cover with foil and bake for 1 hour.

Turn the mixer off and let the dough rest for 5 minutes before mixing on medium speed for another 5 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Turn out onto a table and shape into a rough ball. Use 1 Tbsp of the olive oil to coat the inside of a large bowl before transferring the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a plate and set into the fridge to proof overnight.
The next day, take the risen dough out of the fridge and transfer to an 18” x 13” sheet tray coated with the remaining olive oil. Cover and let it rest, allowing the dough to come up to room temperature, about 30 minutes to an hour.
Meanwhile, to make the sauce, add the whole canned tomatoes to a bowl. Using your hands, or a food mill if you prefer, crush the tomatoes. Grate in the garlic cloves, followed by the pecorino and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and set aside.

(alternatively, use a rolling pin to gently crush the saffron). In a small saucepan, warm the milk slightly until it reaches 98ºF. This isn’t necessary for the instant yeast, but the slightly warmed milk will help to bloom the saffron (this also makes it easy to substitute in active dry yeast, which would need to be activated with warm milk anyway). If it gets too hot, let it cool down before moving on to step 3 so it doesn’t kill the yeast.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir to combine the ground saffron and sugar, remaining sugar, yeast, and warmed milk. Add the flour, eggs, butter, and salt.
Attach the bread hook and knead on medium speed until the dough has come away from the bottom of the bowl and looks smooth, 25 to 35 minutes, depending on the power of your mixer. Trust the process and don’t add more flour unless absolutely necessary; it will look very wet to start, but by the time it’s done kneading, it will have come together fully.
Before you remove the dough from the mixer, test you’ve kneaded long enough by doing the window pane stretch test. Grab a piece of dough between your hands and gently stretch it; if you can stretch it thin enough to where light peaks through, it’s done. If it rips easily, keep kneading.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to proof until doubled in size, about 1 hour (see tip).

Place it over medium heat and whisk until thickened and reaches at least 150ºF on a kitchen thermometer, 2 to 3 minutes. At 150ºF the starches gelatinize. If it turns into a glue-like texture that doesn’t really thicken all that much start again–this means too much of the liquid has evaporated.
Make the dough: Transfer the tangzhong to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough attachment, then add the yeast, milk, sugar, butter, egg, salt, and 2 ¾ cups of the flour. Knead the dough until it mostly comes away from the sides but still partly remains on the bottom of the bowl, looks smooth, and feels tacky but not too sticky, 15 to 20 minutes (you may need to knead longer depending on your mixer–don't stop until you've successfully completed step 3). NOTE: If it still looks too wet, add the remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons; this will depend on the humidity level in your kitchen and time of year).
Grab a small piece of dough and stretch it between your hands to perform a window pane test. If you can stretch it wide and thin enough where light comes through, it’s ready to proof. If it breaks quickly or easily, keep kneading. It’s crucial that you knead the dough long enough in order to get a really feathery, soft texture with lots of gluten development.
Cover tightly with plastic wrap (this helps prevent the top from drying out and forming a skin) and place it in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hours. You can check to see if it’s done rising by poking it; if it pops back quickly it needs to rise more, if it comes back slowly or stays mostly dented it’s done.
Shape the dough: Divide the dough into 9 equal sized pieces (my risen dough weighed 666 grams so I divided each into balls weighing 74 grams, but if you don’t have a scale just eyeball). Without flouring the surface, use a rolling pin to roll a ball of dough into an 8x3-inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds lengthwise, then turn 90 degrees and use a rolling pin to flatten it again. Roll up into a cylinder, then flip the ends down so it turns into a ball. Cup your hands over and drag it gently across the counter until it’s round and has a smooth surface. Assemble in a 10-inch cast iron skillet lined with parchment paper. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to proof until nearly doubled in size, another 45 minutes.
Bake the buns: While the buns are proofing, preheat the oven to 350ºF with a rack placed in the lower rack. Brush the tops with milk, then bake until deep golden brown and read at least 190ºF on a kitchen thermometer, 30 to 35 minutes (place tin foil on top if browning too quickly).

Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the flour until most of the butter is mixed in, and resembled the size of small peas. Combine the ice water and vinegar and add it a tablespoon at a time to the flour mixture, mixing with a fork or your hands, until the dough holds together. Press the dough into a round disc, then wrap in plastic and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

Cut the softened butter into large dice-sized cubes, then transfer to a bowl and place in the refrigerator until cold. The butter will cut easier if softened, but will need to be cold to make the pie crust (you can do this step ahead).
Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Add the cold butter, and pulse until the butter is broken down into small pebble-like pieces.
Remove the lid from the food processor and pour the water and vinegar on top of the butter/flour mixture. Quickly close the lid, and pulse until the dough looks hydrated, but is not one mass. If you notice wet pieces of dough on the side of the food processor, use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides.
Transfer the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap, and gently pack into a rectangle. There should be visible specks of butter in the dough. Allow to chill overnight in the refrigerator.
The next day pull the dough out, and allow it to temper for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature. The butter should be smearable when pressed with your fingers.
On a well-floured surface, roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch thickness, and do a letter fold. Repeat this step 2 more times (3 times in total) There is no need to chill between folds. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and allow it to chill overnight.
