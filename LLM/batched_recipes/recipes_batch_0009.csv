Prepare and bake in a 9x5-inch loaf pan according to the directions. Let cool completely. Cut the matcha pound cake into large slices and use a small* Christmas tree cookie cutter (or cookie cutter of your choice) to cut shapes from the pound cake.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, and then immediately reduce to a low simmer. Add the remaining glaze ingredients and stir to combine.
Let the mixture simmer for about an hour, or until it becomes syrupy and reduces by half. Don't turn up the heat if you can avoid it, low heat is key to making the perfect glaze without burning the sugar. Be sure not to let the glaze boil up.
For the Burgers:
Divide the ground sirloin into 6 equal-sized portions. They should be about the size of tennis balls.
Very gently, round out each ball and then flatten each ball to create your patty. You want to make sure to do this all very gently, and you don't want to over-handle the meat.
Gently press your thumb into the center of each patty to make a slight indent. This will prevent the burgers from bloating as they cook, so you won't have to flatten them while grilling. Season with salt and pepper and set aside while you prepare the bacon.
Cover a baking pan with aluminum foil and line out your bacon on top. The bacon can be very close together, but you don't want it to overlap. You may need to use two pans.
Place the pan or pans in the cold oven and then heat to 400° F.
After 17 minutes, check your bacon. If it's completely crispy, take it out. If not, check every 3 minutes until it is done. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to absorb excess grease.
Preheat the grill to high heat. When it's ready, place the burgers on the hottest part of the grill.
After 5 minutes or so, you should notice the juices as they begin to fill the divots in the top of your burger. This means that the meat is cooking in the middle, and they should be ready to be flipped.
Gently flip the burgers and grill for about a minute before you brushing on the Jack Daniels glaze using a basting brush. Let cook for another 2 minutes, and then top with the cheese. Close the lid to melt the provolone cheese onto the burger. When the cheese is melted (it should only take a minute or so), you're ready to serve the burger.
If you're not sure your burgers are done, check with an instant read thermometer. The USDA recommends at least 160°F for ground meat. All grills are different, so if you're not sure, it's better to check.
Let the burgers sit as you toast the buns. Then, add a little extra glaze to the bottom of each bun, then add the burger and all of the fixings you like! Serve immediately.",en,True,,False,False

Using a fork, whisk the eggs, gradually pulling in a little flour from the edges. Keep whisking and incorporating flour until it starts forming a shaggy dough.
Use your hands to bring the dough together and start kneading. Press it forward with the heel of your hand, fold it over, rotate, and repeat. Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky. If it’s too sticky, dust with a little more flour; if too dry, wet your hands slightly and keep kneading.
Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This lets the gluten relax so the dough rolls out smoothly.
After resting, cut the dough into four equal pieces. Lightly flour your work surface and flatten one piece into a rough rectangle. Set your pasta roller to the widest setting and run the dough through once. Fold it in half, turn it 90 degrees, and roll again. Repeat this process 3-4 times until the dough feels smooth and more elastic.
Now, start rolling it thinner. Reduce the roller setting one notch at a time and run the dough through once per setting until you reach your desired thickness usually the second-to-last or last setting for fettuccine or lasagna sheets, slightly thicker for pappardelle.
