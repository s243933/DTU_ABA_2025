    "To go beyond a theoretical solution, we decided to create a functional app/website taking all the model logic so far mentioned, which allows possible users to actually interact with the system designed in a real, more tangible way. With this approach, we aim to close the gap between technical data analysis and real-world business applications, making our project both practical and impactful. The full application logic and code are contained within a single Python script (`app.py`), with clear inline comments to explain each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Streamlit framework, we designed the app to be impactful, motivational, and informative. Therefore, to start, we added a motivational image related to food waste, helping to capture the userâ€™s attention and set the tone. Following this, a short introductory section is provided with the title, our mission, and some bullet points that highlight the scale of food waste globally, its importance, and what our website does to help tackle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we can successfully match the user input ingredients with the ingredients in our database, two helper functions were created. The first, `normalize_ingredient_name`, standardizes user input by converting it to lowercase and removing plural endings where appropriate. The second function, `match_ingredient`, compares user input with database ingredients at the word level with the help of the first function, making the matching process flexible and more robust, even if users input variations of ingredient names. It is to note that, if the user inputs have spelling mistakes, the system may not find a matching recipe in our data, as it was not feasible within the current timeframe to incorporate error correction or suggestion features. Nevertheless, implementing these functionalities could be a very valuable and feasible improvement for further development of the project in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, dietary preferences (vegan and vegetarian) are collected with no default preselection (`index=None`), making sure that the users freely choose their dietary preferences. The app verifies that these fields are completed before allowing the search to proceed, with clear warnings if the inputs are missing. The users' responses are stored in boolean variables, `vegan` and `vegetarian`, which are later used to filter recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereafter, the users arrive at the stage to input the near-expiry ingredients they have. They do so within the `ðŸ¥¬ Enter Ingredients` section of the app, where there is a highlighted section to be aware of spelling mistakes, plus a text box to add the aforementioned ingredients. There can be more than one item inputted at once, but they need to be comma-separated - as it is mentioned in the user input area. Once the dietary selections and ingredient(s) are provided, the users are instructed to press the \"Find Recipes\" button, which loads the recipe data `(recipe_df = pd.read_csv('receipts_table.csv'))`, filtering only heat-processed recipes for practicality. Matching recipes are found using the `find_heat_processed_ingredient` function, which checks that all user-provided ingredients match those in a recipe, while also respecting any dietary restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If matching recipes are found, the app displays a list of recipe titles that match the criteria inputted, followed by detailed information for each recipe, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions. Otherwise, the app shows a text warning, ensuring that the user experience remains clear and informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the app and its code, we make sure to integrate strong error handling and a good overall structure, separating normalization, matching, and filtering into individual functions, to ensure that the app is easy to understand and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a functional app rather than just a static report, we wanted to simulate how this project could be applied in the real world. In practice, users would simply input what ingredients they have at home that are about to go bad, and immediately receive meal ideas tailored to their needs, dietary restrictions, and available food, thus minimizing waste and maximizing resource use."
