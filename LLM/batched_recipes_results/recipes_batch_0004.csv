Oven Cooking Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each other.
Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Once browned, transfer them to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until they're cooked through.
Stove Top Cooking Instructions
Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet. Add half of the meatballs to the skillet.
Cook them, turning every couple of minutes, until browned on all sides and cooked through. Repeat with the second batch.
Once cooked, transfer them to a pot of red sauce and simmer for a few minutes more before serving.
Freezing Instructions
You can freeze this recipe either cooked or uncooked. I prefer freezing them already cooked so they can go straight from the freezer into a pot of red sauce and then just simmer until heated through. Cooked meatballs should be completely cooled before placing in a gallon-sized freezer bag and transferred to the freezer.
