# Anti-Food Waste Recommendation System

## Project Overview

Food waste is a serious global issue, with huge amount of edible food thrown away every year. Our project aims to help individuals, food sharing platforms, and supermarkets reduce waste by suggesting recipes using ingredients near their expiration date. For raw ingredients like vegetables or fruits, a user would ideally not want to consume a not-so-fresh version of them in their raw form. For example, if a user wants to use a not-so-fresh tomato, they would not want to see recipes of salads which is what they might see if they were to use a generic recipe recommeder. This is because they do not take into account the freshness of an ingredient. Our sustainable alternative takes the freshness of an ingredient into account and provides a reasonable recipe output!
