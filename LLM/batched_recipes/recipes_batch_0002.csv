Chop the lettuce, chop the cabbage, and chop the kale (reference the linked videos if desired). Make sure the greens are washed and thoroughly dried. Store in a sealed container; the greens mix stays fresh up to 5 days. For maximum freshness, we like to cut half the batch and then chop a second batch later in the week, but you can also cut it all at once.
Make the protein
Decide which proteins you’d like, and which you’d like to prep in advance versus prep before serving. Cooked chicken lasts 3 to 4 days refrigerated, and cooked tofu lasts 4 to 5 days refrigerated. Shrimp is best to cook the day of serving; it takes 5 to 10 minutes to prep. Canned chickpeas, beans, tuna or salmon can be mixed up in minutes the day of.
Make a grain (optional)
You can add a grain to make the dish more filling, though we don’t always do this. Prep these in advance and refrigerate until serving. For the rice, you can reheat it with a splash of water on the stovetop and heat over medium low until it is warmed through (it becomes very dry when cooled). Cooked quinoa, rice, farro, or couscous last up to 5 days refrigerated.
Prep toppings (optional)
If desired, chop some of the salad toppings in advance as well and refrigerate; vegetables tend to last 2 to 3 days chopped (or you can chop before serving to maximize freshness). Pickled red onions are great to make in advance and use across all the salads.
Prep dressings (optional)
If desired, you can prep dressings in advance or use purchased.

How to Make Pour Over Coffee,"['34 grams light roast or medium roast coffee beans*', '520 grams filtered water (the flavor is best with filtered water**)']",,"Heat a pot of filtered water to 200 to 205F. We use an electric kettle that shows us the exact temperature. You could also use a teapot on the stove — just heat to boiling, then let the water cool down for a few minutes.
Use a food scale to weigh out 34 grams of coffee, then grind it to a medium coarse grind (about the size of kosher or sea salt). We use an electric burr grinder to get a consistent grind.
When the water is heated, place the filter in your Chemex (see the video below for exact instructions). Pour in just a bit of water to wet the filter, then pour out the water into the sink. Place the ground coffee into the Chemex and shake it to level it out.
Place the Chemex on the food scale and tare it so the scale reads 0. Slowly pour in 70 grams of water in a circular motion. Then stop and wait for 1 minute: this allows the coffee to bloom (you may have to tap your scale once so that it doesn’t time out!).
Then slowly add the remaining 520 grams water in two batches, pouring very slowly in concentric circles, pouring right onto the coffee and not touching the coffee filter. Fill to about 1/2 inch from the top (it will likely be around 400 grams water), wait for the water level to go down a bit, and then fill the remaining water up to 520 grams.
After a few minutes, all of the water will filter through the coffee grounds into the pot below. Remove the filter and discard it (we compost ours). Enjoy!",en,True,,True,True

Rinse the saucepan. Add the milk and maple syrup.

How to Make Espresso,"['9 grams espresso roast coffee for single shot, 18 grams for a double shot', 'Espresso machine (or see alternative methods in the note below!)', 'Knock box']",,"Grind the coffee until it’s very fine ground. Different roasts and brands of beans will require a different grind for your machine. You may need to do a few test runs to get it dialed in just right.
Pack and tamp the coffee grounds
Add the coffee grounds to the espresso basket (portafilter) until it’s slightly heaping over the top. Use the tamper to press the grounds evenly into the portafilter, pressing very firmly until it is fully compressed. It’s useful to have something to press onto for tamping so that you don’t damage the counter or filter. Place the portafilter on a folded towel before tamping, or the best tool is the ledge of a knock box (you can also use it to discard the used grounds). It’s important for the coffee grounds to be as even and straight as possible to get the best espresso shot.
Pull the shot
Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and press the button to pull the shot. Most home espresso machines have an automatic option for this. A well-pulled shot will last around 25 to 30 seconds and have deep espresso flavor with a nice crema (foamy topping).
Consider any adjustments
It takes a while to hone in the grind of the coffee and the tamping process. Don’t worry if it’s not exactly right the first time! If you find that the shot is watery, use slightly more coffee grounds or use a finer grind on the coffee. If the shot takes longer than 30 seconds, reduce the amount of coffee grounds or use a coarser grind on the coffee.",en,True,,True,True

Make the espresso
Use an espresso machine to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug.
Steam the milk
Heat the steam wand. Once prepared, place the wand just below the surface of the milk about 1/2 inch from the side, tilting the jug slightly. Keep it in that position for about 5 to 10 seconds, stretching the milk by about 30% in height, with very slight movements up and down. Once stretched and slightly foamy, lower the nozzle about another 1/2 inch and tilt the pitcher just enough to get a spinning vortex, which incorporates the foam, turning it into a velvety microfoam. Keep that still and spinning until the temperature is about 150 degrees Fahrenheit. (Using a pitcher with a temperature sticker is very helpful.) Turn off the steam before removing the wand from the jug. Wipe the wand with a clean cloth. Turn it on for 1 second to purge the nozzle. Tap and swirl the pitcher to incorporate any bubbles on top. The final texture should look like wet paint or melted ice cream, smooth and velvety. You’ll use only about half of this quantity and can discard the rest (see the * note below).
Make the latte art (watch the video first!)
Tap the milk container on counter and swirl it to break down any large bubbles. Hold the jug a few inches above the coffee and pour in enough milk to fill the mug about halfway, swirling to incorporate the milk. Then lower the jug all the way to the surface. Tilt the mug 45 degrees towards yourself. Pour the milk into the center of the mug while jiggling the jug left to right to make the heart design (for the leaves), then lift and make another smaller heart design on top (the tulip flower).

Stir to combine. Add the water and olive oil and stir until a raggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.
Knead the dough by pushing with the base of your palm, then reforming it into a ball. Continue kneading for 8 minutes until the dough feels pillowy and has a smooth, stretchy exterior. If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of flour while kneading. Alternatively: attach the dough hook to a stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes.
After the kneading is finished, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Using floured hands, gently shape each half into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Set each boule on a floured surface and dab the dough with a bit of olive oil to keep it moist. Cover all boules with a damp towel and allow them to rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
The dough can be used immediately: go to Step 6. For next-level flavor, you can transfer the dough to separate sealed containers, large enough for the dough to double in size again, and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. (We don’t always do this, but we try when possible because it makes for a noticeably nutty, unique flavor that truly is the best homemade pizza dough you’ve ever had.) You can also freeze pizza dough you don’t plan to use that day.
**If you're using the dough after refrigerating
The day of serving, remove the dough from the refrigerated containers, place it on a lightly floured surface covered with a towel, and allow it to come to room temperature before stretching, 30 to 45 minutes. (This is not required if you’re using the dough immediately after proofing.)
To stretch the dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and gently press it into a circle, flipping several times and adding a pinch of flour if it is too sticky. Once you have about an 8-inch circle, pick up the dough and gently drape it over the knuckles on both of your hands. Slowly rotate it around, allowing gravity to stretch it into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Do not overwork or fold the dough. If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for a few minutes, at which point it will stretch more easily.

Transfer the oats to a large bowl and mix in the peanut butter, honey, oats, salt and cinnamon in a bowl. Stir in mix-ins.
Form into bars
Add a sheet of parchment paper to a 9″ x 9″ pan, letting the edges drape over the sides. Place the mixture into the pan and press it into an even layer. Add a few more mix-ins to the top of the bars, if you’d like. Use a small glass to roll over the top to make them as smooth as possible.
Freeze and cut the bars
Freeze the bars for 10 minutes. Then remove the pan from the freezer and use the parchment to lift the bars out of the pan. Use a sharp knife to cut them into 20 rectangles (that are 4 x 5 inches) or 14 bar sized shapes (that are 4 1/2 by 1 1/4 inches). Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

Bake until the potatoes are tender and lightly browned on the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes. Prick them with a fork to assess doneness. (While baking, you can cook the bacon if using, and prep the other toppings.)
Remove the flesh: Allow the potatoes cool slightly. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a 1/4-inch border around the flat edge of the potato, then use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides (cutting with a knife first helps to puncture the crisp roasted surface).

Optional step: If you’re using 100% corn tortillas, you may want to pan fry each one in a skillet with a drizzle of olive oil (or without in a dry pan) to prevent cracking and help them be easier to work with. Every tortilla brand is different, so if your tortillas seem brittle it’s helpful to heat them before rolling. You can do this with corn tortillas too!
Lay a tortilla on a work surface. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the bean mixture in a dollop onto the bottom half of the tortilla. Be careful not to use too much! Tightly roll the tortilla from the bottom (the filling will spread out and hold the tortilla together). Place the flauta seam-side down on the baking sheet. Repeat for the remaining tortillas.

In medium bowl, stir together the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and vinegar and stir with a wooden spoon or dough whisk until all flour is incorporated. Place the bowl in a proofing bag or cover with plastic wrap. Rest at room temperature overnight (12 to 18 hours). The resulting dough will be bubbly and very sticky.
Shape the dough:
When ready to bake, remove the dough from the bowl onto a clean, lightly-floured countertop. Gently spread the dough into a square and then fold up each side into a packet. Flip the dough over. Place your hands behind the dough and gently pull the dough towards you to increase the tension on the surface of the dough. Rotate and repeat until you have a boule shape. Follow this video tutorial for boule shaping technique.
Proof the dough for 1 hour
Place the boule on a piece of parchment paper about twice the width of the boule. Cover the dough with an inverted large bowl and rest one hour.
Preheat the oven
Preheat the Dutch oven (with lid) at 475°F for 30 minutes. (Or for the pizza stone method, place the pizza stone on middle rack of oven, off to one side. Place a cast iron pan or thickest baking sheet on the rack just below and off to the other side of oven. You’ll pour water into it later to create steam.)
Score the bread
Use a sharp knife or lame to cut several shallow slits at angle across the top of the dough. The photographs show this cross pattern.

Prepare the banneton by rubbing the 50/50 rice flour mixture into all of the grooves of the banneton. Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured counter. Rub just enough flour onto the top of the dough so that it isn’t tacky. Use the bench scraper to flip the dough so that the floured side is down. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle. Moving quickly, fold the top third of the dough down, and the bottom third up to create a packet. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and gently roll it into a log shape. Be careful to not press the dough or deflate it. Use your hands to gently pull the dough tight and pinch off the seams at the end of the dough. Rub a little more flour onto the top of the dough so that it isn’t tacky. Gently flip the dough into the banneton and pinch off the bottom seam. Tip: Watch the video instructions for shaping the dough (7:54 to 8:50). Place the banneton into the proofing bag and proof 45 to 60 minutes, until doubled in size.

How to Cook Corn on the Cob (5 Ways!),['4 to 8 ears corn'],,"Boiled
Place 1 tablespoon salt in a large pot of water and bring it to a boil. This takes about 15 to 20 minutes, so plan accordingly. Shuck the corn, removing the silk.When the water is boiling, place the corn cobs in the pot. Boil covered for 5 minutes, until bright yellow and cooked through. Season with butter, salt and pepper.
Grilled
Heat a grill to medium high heat (375 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit). Shuck the corn by peeling down the outside layers one at a time and keeping them attached, facing downwards away from the cob. When you’ve finished, use kitchen twine or string to tie the leaves together (see the photos). This step is optional; it makes a natural handle for eating the corn. Otherwise, simply shuck the corn. Use your hands to rub oil on each corn cob evenly. Place the corn directly on the grill grates and cook until it begins to blacken, then turn. Cook about 12 to 15 minutes total, until blackened on all sides. Serve immediately with butter and salt, using the tied husks as a handle for easy eating.
Grilled in foil
Preheat a grill to medium-high heat (375 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit).Shuck the corn. Place each corn cob in a sheet of aluminum foil. Rub it with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top it with a few thin pats of butter (½ tablespoon in each packet). Seal foil around corn, sealing the edges at the top but not making it too tight. Poke a few small holes in each packet. Place the packets on the grill grates and grill for 20 to 25 minutes, turning occasionally, until corn is bright yellow and cooked.
Oven roasted

Lay the asparagus on a platter or in a pan and pour the oil over them and roll them around until they are lightly covered. Sprinkle on the salt and the spices. Shave the cheese on the long shaving side of a box grater so you have wide ribbons and set it aside.
Fire up. Set up in 2 zones, preheat the grill to medium hot on the direct side. Although we will cook in the hot zone, I always like to have a safe zone on the other side in case some cook too fast.

Rendered Beef Tallow And Rendered Animal Fat Recipe,['1 pound animal fat'],,"Collect. Trim the fat from your brisket, prime rib, pork butt, or peel off the skins from poultry. Or just ring the bell at the butcher counter and ask for trimmings. Many will give you whatever you want for free. Chop up chunks about 1 to 2-inches square. You don’t need to be precise. If there’s a little meat attached, that’s OK. Don’t grind it as some people recommend. You can freeze it for when you are ready to render.
Render. Most animal fats begin to liquefy, a.k.a. render, at about 130°F. You don’t want to render your fat too hot or it will extract flavors from any remaining meat and darken the fat. Many people render fats in pans or pots on top of the stove. It smells funky, so you might want to do this outdoors on your grill’s side burner or on a gas grill. You can also render fat in your grill or smoker next time you are doing a long, low and slow cook of ribs, brisket or pulled pork. You will get a bonus, smoky fat. Just put the chunks in a Dutch oven or a pan in the pit in the indirect zone and stir every 30 minutes or so. If you don’t want smoke flavor, cover it. It is easiest to control the temperature in a Dutch oven in your oven, or in a slow cooker. Either way, place your collected fat in a Dutch oven and, to prevent burning, add enough water to come about halfway up the fat. Place the pot on a burner set for medium heat or in an oven, smoker or grill set to 225°F or 250°F. Let it boil, lid off, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom, until the water boils away, anywhere from 3 to 6 hours. Check it regularly. When the water is gone and you can see that the fat is what is left boiling in the pot, turn the heat to low (or keep a steady 225ºF temperature in a smoker or oven). You can stop now and pour off the fat, or let it go a bit longer until it fries the remaining meat and connective tissue.
Clarify. When you have a pot full of golden liquid, scoop out and discard the solids. Pour the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a clean jar, screw on the lid, and refrigerate or freeze for months.

Cool. Remove the fish and paper together from the smoker or grill, then let the fish cool on the paper until it's about room temperature.
Skin, crumble, and chill. Slip the edge of a spatula or knife between the flesh and skin and peel the paper off. The skin should come with it. Crumble the flesh with your fingers, searching meticulously for rogue bones. Cover the crumbled flesh and set it in the fridge.
Make the dressing. While the fish is smoking, pull the cream cheese out of the fridge, cut it into 6 chunks, and place it in a bowl at room temperature so it can soften up for 15 minutes or so.

There is often a tough silverskin membrane beneath the fat cap that needs to go, too. Yes, this is a lot of waste from a cut that was expensive to begin with. Work carefully so you don't waste any of this expensive meat. To completely French the bones, remove all the meat between the bones so the bone is bare and showy. Or, leave that little sliver of meat between the bones. It usually overcooks but is pretty tasty. Your call.
After trimming, I like to take one more step to increase the marvelous Maillard and caramelization flavors of a brown surface. I cut the rack into four sections, each two bones wide. These are called lollipops because the knob of meat, perhaps 2"" (5cm) diameter and 1.5"" (3.8cm) thick, can easily be eaten without the aid of knife and fork in about six bites. Yes, you could cut the rack into single bone sections, but then you're left with lollipops that are so thin that they overcook inside before getting properly browned on the outside. For an 8-bone rack, I prefer to cut the rack into four fat chops by slicing between every second bone. Try to make them the same thickness so the will cook at the same rate.
Apply the wet rub. Use a lot. Much of it will fall off during cooking. You can let it marinate for a while, but it really won't penetrate much. One to three hours is enough.
Fire up. Preheat the grill for 2-zone cooking with the direct heat side at Warp 10.
Cook. Warm the meat gently on the indirect side with the lid down until it hits about 125°F (52°C). Then move the chops over the direct side to sear the exterior. Leave the lid open and place the bones over the edge away from the heat so they don't burn. This technique of warming the meat before grilling over direct heat is called reverse sear and it insures the most even colored interior possible. When you turn the meat try not to drag it across the grates and scrape off the rub, but turn often, about every 2 minutes. Take it up to 130°F or 135°F (54 to 57°C) for medium rare (rosy color) or 140°F (60°C) for medium (pink).
Serve. Usually I want you to salt meat long before you cook (dry brining), but this small cut is best if you save a coarse salt for the end, just after serving, like granules on a pretzel. Go easy, it won't need much.
Lamb Ribeye Steaks
Here's an alternative way to prepare the rack. Trim the fat as described above, but completely remove the meat from the ribs, cutting as close to the bones as possible. You'll be left with a 12 to 14 ounce (346 to 397mg) tube of lamb ribeye meat similar in size to a pork tenderloin. Apply the wet rub and marinate in the fridge for 1 to 3 hours, then grill the whole lamb ribeye right alongside the ribs as described above. Slice the meat into medallions (steaks), and serve them with the bones on the side. Great fun! Check out the video ""A Better Way To Prepare Rack Of Lamb"" above to see how it's done.
Whole Rack Of Lamb
Finally, the traditional method is to roast or grill the whole rack of lamb with the fat trimmed and bones Frenched as described above. Many recipes call for coating the meat with mustard and breadcrumbs. But that covers the meat and then you're browning the mustard and breadcrumbs instead of browning the meat. I prefer the flavor of browned meat. I just rub the Frenched rack with Dolly's Lamb Rub And Past, grill it over high heat, and sprinkle it with large grain seasoned salt at the table.",en,True,,False,False
Grilled Green Onions Scallions Recipe,"['2 bunches of scallions', 'olive oil', 'salt and pepper to taste', '⅓ cup romesco sauce']",,"Prep. Rinse the scallions, cut off the dead and brown greens, chop off the roots, pull off the dirty outer layer from the bulbs, and sprinkle them lightly with salt, pepper, and olive oil in that order.
Fire up. Preheat the grill in a 2-zone configuration. Align the grill grates so that you can place the bulbs directly over the hot side, and the greens over the indirect zone, without them falling through. Leave the lid open and stand by the grill, rolling the onions around and letting them char a bit but not blacken too much. The greens should toast nicely, but if they don't get crispy, you can flip the greens over the direct heat for a minute or two.
Serve. Enjoy the grilled calçots with a bowl of romesco sauce for dipping. Wash it down with Catalan wine.

Grilled Leg of Lamb Mechoui Recipe,"['1 leg of lamb (about 4 pounds per leg)', '4 tablespoons ras el hanout spice mix', '1 ½ cups charmoula herb paste', '½ cup harissa hot pepper paste']",,"Prep. Have your butcher remove the bone from the leg and cut off about 6-8"" (15 - 20 cm) of the shank. Freeze the shank for later use. If you get the leg bone still in, you can cut off the shank with a saw and remove the bone with a filleting knife. Remove the thick fat cap, the thin silverskin membrane, and any tendons, sinew, and cartilage while you take the meat apart. I try to remove muscles intact and cut them up into large chunks. Inevitably you will end up with chunks of varying sizes. Group them according to size so you can cook each size for a different lenght of time. Or you can freeze one group for later. Put the meat in a nonreactive pan and cover all surfaces with charmoula. Marinate up to 24 hours if possible. An hour will do, but longer is better.
Fire up. Preheat the grill as hot as you can get it. Sprinkle the ras el hanout on the meat generously, but not thick.
Cook. Grill on one side until it releases from the grate easily and gets good grill marks. Roll it onto the opposite side and take the temp of several pieces immediately. Small pieces will cook fast, and grills have hotspots, so test many pieces. Use this Food Temperature Guide to decide when to take it off. I usually pull it at 125-130°F (52-54°C) for rare meat.

Grill Roasted Leg of Lamb Recipe,"['1 bone-in leg of lamb ((a leg weighs about 9 pounds before trimming))', '½ teaspoon Morton Coarse Kosher Salt ((½ teaspoon salt per pound of meat))', ""1 batch Dolly's Lamb Rub and Paste"", 'Triple size batch of board sauce']",,"Prep. Start the day before if you can by removing as much of the thick fat cap on the surface as possible and all the silverskin underneath. Remove the bones, or not. Your choice.
Now gash the surface by stabbing it repeatedly about 1/2"" (13mm) deep and 1"" (2.5cm) apart or run a sharp blade across the surface in a checkerboard pattern making squares 1 to 2"" (2.5 to 5cm) wide. Click here to read more about the technique of gashing. Sprinkle the salt all over the meat going lighter in the thinner areas. This is called dry brining. Click here to learn more about the concept. Now use butcher string and tie the whole floppy mess into as much of a log shape as possible so it will cook evenly. Your string and knots are going to look sloppy, and you may have problems with loose flaps of meat on the ends, but get them tucked in. I've been known to use toothpicks, and even turkey lacers (shown here). Put it in a pan, and leave it in the fridge overnight.
Make the Dolly's Lamb Rub And Paste and swab the paste all over the meat and deep into the gashes.
Fire up. Preheat the cooker in a 2-zone setup so the indirect side is about 225°F (107°C). I know a lot of recipes call for higher temps, but I'm here to tell you, this cut performs much better at low temps so the tough connective tissues and copious fat can liquefy (read more about this concept in my article about meat science). If you have a digital thermometer with a probe that can be left in, insert it now. If you are cooking bone-in, make sure your thermometer probe is about 1"" away from the bone in the thickest piece of the meat. If you wish to add some smoke flavor, add a small amount of dry wood now, perhaps a handful, depending on your cooker. The more ventilation the more wood.
Cook. Place the leg of lamb on the indirect side and cook with the lid down until the meat hits about 110°F (43°C). Then move the whole clod of meat over to the direct heat side and sear it until it is dark on all four sides or until the meat is 130 to 135°F (54 to 57°C) max. In the photo above you can see how I used a pair of bricks wrapped in foil to hold the roast on edge and get an all-over sear.
Prep again. While the meat is cooking, prepare a board sauce, heavy on rosemary and/or mint. You can make it in a bowl or cup.
Pour the board sauce on the board, plop the meat on top of it and start carving. You want the juices to mingle with the sauce.

Prepare pistachios: Add 1 cup pistachio to the bowl of a food processor and process on high until pistachios are finely ground, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground pistachios and set aside for decorating the cake later.
Mix together the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, add the pistachios (minus the 1 to 2 tablespoons reserved), then whisk in the almond flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
Mix together the wet ingredients: In a separate large bowl, add the sugar and lemon zest and use clean fingers to rub the zest into the sugar for 1 minute. This will infuse the lemon flavor into the sugar. Next add the eggs, yogurt, lemon juice and almond extract; whisk until smooth and well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix well with a wooden spoon until smooth. Mix in 1 to 2 drops of dye free food coloring if you want it more green and fun!
Bake the cakes: Divide batter evenly between pans and spread out with a spatula to smooth the tops. Bake for 18-25 minutes in the two 8-inch pans or 22-28 minutes for three 6-inch pans. My 6-inch pans were done at 25 minutes. Cakes are done when a tester comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached. Allow the cake to cool completely before removing from the pans. The cake should be room temperature when you frost it. This is very important. Cakes can be made a day ahead if you’d like and kept individually well wrapped in the fridge.
Make your frosting according to the recipe here.
Frost the cake: Place about 1 to 2 tablespoons down onto the cake stand and spread out. Run a butter knife around the edges of the pan for easy removal then invert a cake onto the cake stand (so the flat side is up), add about 1/2 heaping cup frosting and spread toward the edges. Add 3 tablespoons (if using 6-inch cakes) or 6 tablespoons (if using 8-inch cakes) of strawberry jam on top of the frosting and use a knife to spread towards the edge leaving about ¼ inch border so the jam doesn’t squish out of the cake. Place the next layer of cake, flat-side up, on top of the first layer, and repeat, topping with an additional 1/2 cup of frosting and spreading it to the edge. Top with another 3 tablespoons of strawberry jam (if using a 6-inch cake). Place the third layer (if using) flat-side up on top, then frost the top and sides of the cake with ½ cup of frosting, using a bench scraper or offset spatula to create a uniform, very thin layer of frosting around the cake. It helps to do this while slowly spinning the cake stand and gently pressing the scraper against the side of the cake. (This step is called a crumb coat which will allow for a beautiful, seamless look once complete.)
Transfer the cake to the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes, until the crumb coat layer of frosting has firmed up to the touch. Once the cake is chilled, repeat the process of frosting the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting, using an offset spatula. Since the cake has been chilled, the crumb coat should allow for a smoother finish. If the cake is slightly ‘naked’ on the outside, that’s okay, it’s going to be delicious! Garnish with a dusting of reserved ground pistachios. Top with fresh strawberries (or mixed berries) in the middle just before serving the cake to make sure they stay as fresh as possible!

In a medium pot, add the sugar and lime zest and use clean fingers to rub the mixture together for about 30 seconds so the lime releases into the sugar and infuses it with flavor. Next, add the lime juice, eggs, and flour and whisk together until the mixture is well combined and no streaks of egg remain. Do not add in the butter or food dye yet. Set the pot aside.
In a medium bowl, add the almond flour, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract and salt. Mix together with a fork until it forms a nice thick crumb texture. Add to the pan and use your fingers to evenly press down into the pan. Bake for 8-9 minutes until the crust is slightly golden brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Keep heat in the oven.
While the crust cooks, place the pot over medium-low heat and whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 6 to 8 minutes. Once the mixture has thickened, remove from heat.
Place a sieve (fine mesh strainer) over a medium bowl. Pour mixture into the sieve and use a spoon to work and mash down the filling through the stainer.
In the bowl with the warm lime filling, stir in the butter until melted and a few drops of green food dye to achieve a vibrant green color, if desired. Immediately pour the mixture over the warm crust and tilt the pan or spread with a spatula to evenly distribute the lime filling. Place the pan back in the oven and bake for another 8 to 11 minutes until the filling is set and barely jiggly when the pan is gently shaken.

Dust with powdered sugar and cut into 16 bars using a clean, sharp, wet knife. Clean and wet the knife after each cut. Annoying, but it helps to get the perfect cut! Add a little extra lime zest on top if you want a little extra zing.
To store: Place leftover bars in an airtight container and place in the fridge for up to 4 days. If you are stacking the bars, add a sheet of parchment paper in between the layers to prevent sticking.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined -- DO NOT OVERMIX; it’s okay if the batter is slightly lumpy (and yes it will also be pretty thick!). These are supposed to be thick, fluffy pancakes. If you want them slighly thinner, gently fold in 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.
In a medium bowl, mix together the blueberries and 1 tablespoon of flour so that the blueberries are well-coated in flour. Gently fold the blueberries into the pancake batter, being sure not to over mix. Let the batter sit for 5 to 10 minutes while you heat up your pan. This will create an even fluffier, melt-in-your-mouth pancake.
Cook the pancakes: Place a large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with butter. Once the oil has melted, add approximately ¼ cup of the batter for each pancake (use 1 tablespoon for mini pancakes), leaving room for the batter to spread and, if necessary, use the back of a spoon to spread about ½-inch thick, and cook until the pancakes slightly puff up and you see a few bubbles along the edges, 2 to 4 minutes.
To check if the pancakes are ready to be flipped, lift a corner of the pancake with a flexible spatula turner; if they are golden brown on the bottom, this usually indicates that it’s time to flip.
Gently flip the cakes and cook until golden brown on the underside, about 2 minutes more. If you find the pancakes are browning too quickly, or if the griddle or pan starts smoking at any point, reduce the heat to medium-low.

Set aside.
Place bacon in a single layer in large skillet and place over medium heat, cook bacon on both sides until golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke at any point, simply lower the heat.
Once bacon is done, transfer to a cutting board and blot with a paper towel to absorb excess grease, then chop into bite sized pieces and set aside. If you used regular bacon, drain bacon grease from pan, leaving only about a tablespoon of grease in the pan. You’ll be using this pan for the pasta so remove it from the heat and the hot burner and set on aside on the stovetop.
While the bacon is cooking, place a large pot of water over high heat and add in a generous amount of salt. Once the water boils, stir in the pasta and cook until al dente.
Once pasta is done cooking, reserve 1 cup of pasta water and set aside, then drain remaining pasta in a colander. IMMEDIATELY transfer pasta to the pan you cooked the bacon in; the pan might still be warm but it should not be over any direct heat.
Slowly stir in the egg and parmesan mixture and use tongs to coat the pasta with the mixture. The warmth of the pasta will help cook the eggs and make them nice and creamy to coat the pasta. The eggs should not be curdled or chunky. Add in about 1/3 cup reserved pasta water, plus more as necessary to make the sauce creamier.

Dump the mixture into a 9-inch pie pan and use clean hands to evenly press the mixture into the bottom and sides of the pan.

In a large bowl, add the sugar and lemon zest and use clean fingers to rub the zest into the sugar for 30 seconds. This will infuse the lemon flavor into the sugar. In the same bowl, add in the eggs, lemon juice, sour cream (or yogurt), cornstarch and salt. Whisk together until well combined.
Pour mixture into the cooled crust.

Add in blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, lemon juice and almond extract. Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture together. Bring to a gentle boil, breaking up the blueberries with the back of a wooden spoon as they cook. Cook mixture, stirring frequently, for approximately 5 to 10 minutes total, until the mixture is thick like jelly and coats the back of the spoon. The thicker it is, the less likely it will be to spill out of the rolls when you roll them up. Set mixture aside to cool completely.
Prepare the dough: In the bowl of an eclectic mixer, or if making by hand, a large bowl, add the sugar and lemon zest. Use clean hands to rub the zest into the sugar for approximately 30 seconds to release and infuse lemon flavor into the sugar.
In a small microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, warm the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds to 1 minute, until it registers 115°F on a thermometer and feels like very warm bath water (but it shouldn’t be too hot!). Add the warmed milk into the bowl with the sugar and sprinkle the yeast on top. Wait 3 to 5 minutes to activate the yeast; you will know it is activated when it starts to bubble and foam on top. Add the egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix on medium speed until well combined, 30 seconds. (Alternatively, mix with a wooden spoon until well combined.) Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour and salt until a dough begins to form (this will prevent flour from flying everywhere!).
Knead the dough: Place the dough hook on the stand mixer and return the bowl to the mixer. Knead the dough on medium speed, 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a well-floured surface.) Please know that this is a sticky dough, but if measured properly they will bake up beautifully!
Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough ball to the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and the warm towel. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (This may be more or less time depending on the time of year, the humidity, and the temperature in your home.) You will know the dough has risen enough when you poke your finger into the dough about an inch without the indentation bouncing back immediately.
Generously dust a clean surface with flour. Transfer the risen dough to the surface and use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 10x14-inch rectangle.
Prepare the filling: Spread the blueberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1/4th inch margin at the far short side of the dough. Using a spatula or spoon, evenly spread the blueberry filling all over the dough.
Starting from the short side (the 10 inch side) without the margin, very tightly roll up the dough. Seal the far edge of the dough as best you can by pinching the dough together just slightly, then make sure the dough log is seam-side down. Cut a ½-inch off the ends of the dough, as the ends won’t have enough filling; feel free to discard (or bake separately as yummy extras). Use your hands to give the dough log a gentle push inwards on both ends so that it compacts slightly, as it may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process.
Using unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, cut the dough into nine 1-inch slices.
Line a round or square 9-inch pan with parchment paper. Place the rolls in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let rise again until the rolls have puffed up, are doubled in size, and touch each other in the pan, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.
Once the rolls have risen, remove the plastic wrap and towel and bake until just golden brown on the edges, about 20 to 25 minutes. Not overbaking the rolls ensures that they will stay soft in the middle.
While the rolls bake, prepare the lemon cream cheese frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Beat on low speed to start, then increase to medium-high speed and mix until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. (Alternatively, whisk the frosting by hand.) Immediately spread the frosting over the rolls so the frosting gets into every little nook and cranny of the roll and then serve. ENJOY!

Buffalo Cauliflower Mac and Cheese,"['For the cauliflower:', '4-6 cups cauliflower florets', '1 tablespoon olive oil or avocado oil', 'Freshly ground salt and pepper', 'For the mac and cheese:', '8 ounces dry pasta shells or cavatappi (or any pasta you’d like, gluten free if desired)', '2 tablespoons butter', '¼ cup all purpose flour (or sub whole wheat or GF all purpose flour)', '½ teaspoon onion powder', '½ teaspoon garlic powder', '1 ¾ cups unsweetened cashew milk, almond milk or regular milk', '6 oz sharp cheddar cheese (about 1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese)', '½ cup medium to hot buffalo sauce', 'For topping:', '2 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded and reserved for the topping (or about ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese)', '¾ cup panko breadcrumbs', '1 tablespoon melted butter', 'To garnish:', 'Green onion, (green part only)']",,"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add cauliflower, drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss well to coat the cauliflower in the oil. Roast for 25-30 minutes or until tender and slightly golden, flipping cauliflower halfway through cooking. Keep heat in the oven.
While the cauliflower is cooking you can boil your noodles and make the sauce: boil the noodles in a large pot until al dente, according to the directions on the package. Once done cooking, drain and return noodles to the large pot.
While the noodles are boiling, make your mac and cheese sauce: in a large skillet, add butter and place over medium heat. Once butter is melted, whisk in a little bit of the flour and then slowly add in milk, a little bit at a time, alternating with the flour and vigorously whisking away any lumps. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for a few minutes stirring every so often, until the sauce thickens up a bit. Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, salt and LOTS of freshly ground black pepper.
Next add in 6 ounces (or about 1 ½ cups) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the sauce and stir until completely melted. Pour the cheese sauce over the noodles, then add in buffalo sauce. Stir to completely coat the noodles, then add in your roasted cauliflower and stir again.
Spray a 2-quart baking dish or 9x9 inch or 11x7 inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray, or grease with olive oil or butter. Pour in the cauliflower mac and cheese and spread out. Top with remaining ½ cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese if you like extra cheesiness!
