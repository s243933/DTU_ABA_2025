After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Immediately transfer the butter to a medium bowl to prevent burning, making sure you scrape all the brown butter bits from the bottom of the pan.

Matzo Ball Soup,"['6 large eggs', '½ cup melted schmaltz (chicken fat) or vegetable oil', '6 Tbsp. low-sodium chicken broth or water', '3 Tbsp. chopped dill', '1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp.

Add ½ cup melted schmaltz (chicken fat) or vegetable oil, 6 Tbsp. low-sodium chicken broth or water, 3 Tbsp. chopped fresh dill, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¾ tsp. freshly ground black pepper and whisk vigorously to combine. Add 1½ cups matzo meal and whisk until incorporated. Cover and chill matzo ball mixture at least 35 minutes (this is essential as it gives the matzo meal time to hydrate). Do Ahead: Matzo dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.
While the matzo ball mixture is chilling, place a rack in top third of oven; preheat to 450°. Place 4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3 lb.) on a rimmed baking sheet or a large plate and sprinkle with 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt; let sit at room temperature until ready to use. Spread 6 lb. chicken wings out on another rimmed baking sheet; roast wings until golden brown, 45–55 minutes.
Transfer wings and any accumulated juices on baking sheet to a large pot. Add 2 medium onions, peeled, halved, 2 celery stalks, cut into 2"" pieces, 1 medium parsnip, peeled, cut into 2"" pieces, 1 medium carrot, peeled, cut into 2"" pieces, 1 bunch fresh parsley, 1 Tbsp. black peppercorns, and 4 quarts water. Bring to a simmer and cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain simmer, until stock is slightly reduced, 40–50 minutes. Add seasoned chicken legs and simmer until legs are very tender, another 40–50 minutes.
While the chicken legs cook, bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a medium pot. Add 3 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Using damp hands, divide matzo dough into 16 pieces and roll each into about 1½""-diameter ball. It’s okay to really work the dough into balls; it won’t get dense—trust us, we tried! Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower matzo balls into the gently simmering salted water. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook, checking occasionally and adjusting heat if boiling too rapidly, until balls are puffed and light in color, 30–40 minutes. Don’t remove them sooner than this; they will be dense in the middle if undercooked. Remove from heat and let sit while you finish the soup.
Transfer chicken legs to a plate and let sit until cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium pot; discard solids.
Remove meat from legs; discard skin and bones. Tear meat into bite-size pieces and return shredded chicken to stock. Add remaining 2 medium carrots, peeled, thinly sliced. Return stock to a simmer and cook until carrots are just tender, about 4 minutes. Taste and season soup with more salt if needed.
Using a slotted spoon, place 2 matzo balls in each bowl. Ladle soup over. Garnish with chopped fresh dill and a few grinds of freshly ground pepper. Do Ahead: Matzo balls can be cooked 2 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container along with 2–3 Tbsp. cooking liquid and refrigerate. When reheating, gently lower balls into soup and cook over medium-low until warmed through, about 10 minutes. Chicken stock can be made 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Store chicken leg meat separately.

Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 Tbsp. sugar, and 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil in a large bowl. Place a cabbage leaf flat on a surface with stem end facing you. If bottom end is tough or thick, trim off about 1"". (You can finely chop, lightly salt, and squeeze out excess moisture from up to 1 cup cooked cabbage scraps and add to filling.) Place ¼ cup filling about 1"" from bottom and form into a 2½""-long barrel shape. Fold left and right sides of leaf over, then tightly roll up from bottom to make a cigar-shaped package. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling. Arrange rolls, seam side down, in a single layer in steamer basket and cover.
Working in 2 batches if needed, uncover pot if using; place basket over pot and steam cabbage rolls until filling is cooked through (it should be firm, opaque, and slightly lightened in color), 11–13 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir one 1"" piece ginger, peeled, cut into matchsticks, 1 garlic clove, finely grated, ¼ cup soy sauce (not low-sodium), ¼ cup unseasoned rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. sugar, and ½ tsp. toasted sesame oil in a small bowl to combine.

Heat 3 Tbsp. ghee or vegetable oil in a large ovenproof Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, cook short ribs, meaty side down, until a deeply browned crust forms, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate with tongs, leaving fat in pot.
Cook 2 medium onions, thinly sliced, in same pot, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, 10–12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add reserved garlic paste and cook, stirring often, until paste is beginning to stick to bottom of pot but not burning, about 4 minutes. Add 2 bay leaves and 3 Tbsp. nihari masala; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour in 6–7 cups water (there is little risk of the pot running dry, and you can adjust the sauce consistency at the end, so no need to be exact here) and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up browned bits stuck to bottom of pot. Nestle short ribs back into pot and return liquid to a simmer. Cover pot, transfer to oven, and braise until meat is tender, and liquid is thickened, 2½–3 hours. If the braise seems too soupy for your liking, uncover and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, 20–30 minutes. You can also add a little more water to loosen if needed.

Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl to combine. Toss 1¼ cups (2½ sticks) chilled unsalted butter in dry ingredients to coat, then working quickly, grate cold butter on the large holes of a box grater into the bowl. Toss grated butter to coat, then, using your fingers, work butter into dry ingredients, smashing until the largest pieces are about the size of a lentil.
Tossing constantly with a fork, drizzle in ⅓ cup plus 1 Tbsp. ice-cold water, then using your hands, lightly toss the mixture several times to distribute water evenly. Knead dough in the bowl with your hands until it comes together into a smooth mass with no spots of dry flour remaining. Transfer dough to a sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap and pat into a ½""-thick square. Wrap tightly, pressing out air, then roll over dough with a rolling pin in both directions, forcing it into the corners of the wrapping to make a tightly compacted square. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 36 hours ahead.
Preheat oven to 250°. Combine two 10-oz. packages frozen strawberries, ⅓ cup granulated sugar, 1 pinch kosher salt, and 3 Tbsp. water in a large saucepan and cover. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, uncovering and stirring occasionally, until berries are softened, about 5–8 minutes. Remove from heat and purée with a hand blender, leaving a bit of texture if you like (or transfer to a standard blender and blend, then return to the saucepan). Return to a simmer, uncovered, and cook, stirring often with a heatproof rubber spatula, being sure to scrape the sides and bottom of pan, until filling is thick enough that you can see the bottom of the pot for a second when you scrape the spatula across, 10–15 minutes.
Scrape filling onto a large rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone mat and spread into a thin, even layer. Bake, stirring every 15 minutes with spatula, until it becomes a thick paste that holds its shape (it should resemble tomato paste), 45–60 minutes. Let cool, then transfer filling to a small bowl and stir in 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, and 1 tsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice. Taste and add more lemon juice if desired. Do Ahead: Filling can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
Whisk 1 large egg white and 1 pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl until foamy. Add 2 cups powdered sugar a little bit at a time, whisking constantly and vigorously until you have a thick, smooth, opaque white icing (depending on the size of your egg white, you might not need all the sugar). Divide icing among 5 small bowls and, working one at a time, add food coloring 1 drop at a time, stirring with a spoon, until you have the desired color. Repeat until you have all 5 sprinkle colors: orange, red, pink, green, and yellow. Using an offset spatula, spread each color icing in an even strip across a sheet of parchment paper, making as thin a layer as possible. Slide parchment paper onto a baking sheet and let sit at room temperature until icing has dried and hardened completely, at least 12 hours.
Peel icing off parchment paper and break into smaller pieces with your hands. Place the pieces inside a resealable plastic bag and seal, pressing out any air. Beat the bag lightly with a rolling pin to pulverize the icing into tiny sprinkles. Transfer sprinkles to a fine mesh sieve and shake to remove any tiny, dust-like particles; discard. Pass sprinkles through a colander or slotted spoon, reserving the pieces that fall through and returning any larger pieces that don’t to the bag and breaking up further with rolling pin. Repeat the double-sifting process until you have very small, relatively uniform sprinkles. Transfer to an airtight container, cover, and store at room temperature until you’re ready to assemble the pastries. Do Ahead: Sprinkles can be made 1 week ahead.
Preheat oven to 300°. Line an 18x13"" baking sheet with parchment paper. Unwrap dough and cut in half. Rewrap one half and return to the refrigerator. Roll out remaining dough on a lightly floured surface to about 14x10"" rectangle. Transfer to lined baking sheet.
Using a ruler, lightly score straight lines on the dough to make a 3x3 grid (you should have 9 rectangles, each measuring about 4½"" long and 3¼"" wide (don’t cut all the way through the pastry). Using the ruler, measure and lightly score another set of lines ¼"" from the inside of each rectangle (think of it as making a slightly smaller rectangle inside each of the 9 rectangles. Chill dough until firm, 10–15 minutes.
Remove scored dough from refrigerator and divide cooled filling among rectangles (about a slightly heaping tablespoonful each). Using a small offset spatula or spoon, spread filling in an even layer so it fills up to the lines of the smaller rectangles (you’re leaving the ¼"" border exposed). Transfer to the refrigerator to chill. Roll out second piece of pastry into a 14x10"" rectangle the same way as the first, then prick it all over with a fork.
Separate 1 large egg, placing egg yolk into small bowl and egg white into medium bowl. Beat egg yolk to blend. Remove pastry with filling from refrigerator and brush egg yolk over pastry, working around filling. Drape second piece of pastry over the top, aligning the slabs and pressing out any air pockets. Press firmly around the filling to seal pastry (take care to avoid smooshing the filling) and crimp if desired. Use a bench scraper or pastry cutter to cut between rectangles to make nine 4½x3¼"" pastries; discard any scraps. Space pastries evenly on baking sheet. Chill until pastry is firm, 10–15 minutes.
Bake pastries until golden underneath and puffed but still pale on top, 30–35 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet.
Add 1 pinch of kosher salt to reserved egg white and whisk until foamy. Add 2 cups powdered sugar a little bit at a time, whisking constantly and vigorously until you have a smooth, opaque white icing that falls off the whisk in a slowly dissolving ribbon (depending on the size of your egg white, you might not need all the sugar). Fill a disposable pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with about 2 Tbsp. icing and snip a very small opening from the end or a bottom corner. Pipe thin, even rectangles of icing on the surface of each pop-tart, leaving about ¼"" border. Transfer any icing left in bag back to the bowl, then whisk in ½ tsp. fresh lemon juice and ½ tsp. vanilla extract. Whisk in water a few drops at a time if needed to make the icing a bit more fluid but still thick and opaque. Working with one Pop-Tart at a time, drizzle about 1 tsp. icing inside the icing rectangles and use your finger or a toothpick to cover entire icing rectangle in a thin, even layer (add more icing if needed). You should have a smooth, even application of white icing. Before the icing starts to set, top pastries generously with sprinkles. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour to let the icing set before serving. Do Ahead: Homemade Pop-Tarts can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. After icing has had 24 hours to set, you can reheat in a 300° oven (or toaster oven) until warmed through, 5–8 minutes.

Combine ¼ cup instant espresso powder and 2 Tbsp. Dutch-process cocoa powder in 2 Tbsp. hot water in a medium bowl, smashing and stirring with a rubber spatula, until dissolved and smooth (mixture will be thick and pasty); set espresso mixture aside.

In a large bowl (or container), mix together the 1 1/2 cups warm water, 1 packet yeast (or 2.25 teaspoons), and 1 ½ teaspoons fine grain salt, until yeast and salt are fully or almost dissolved (I like using a whisk for this).
Add the flour.
Add the 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour to the bowl all at once and stir together until a sticky dough forms. Don't worry about mixing it too much, just make sure everything is uniformly wet. It WILL be messy and sticky. You can scrape what's left on the spoon with a silicone spatula. (photo below provided for what the texture should look like - if it seems too wet, add 1-2 tablespoons more flour at a time until it is more like the photo. If it seems too dry, do the same thing with more water).
Allow to rise in a warm place.
Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or place the container to the lid on ajar). Leave it for 2-3 hours to rise in a somewhat warm place until it's doubled in volume, like photo in previous step (If it's cold out, I like to preheat my oven for a few minutes, then turn it off, then place the bowl in the oven, trapping the heat inside. If your house is warm just leave it out, or if it's warm outside you can place it there).
Bake or refrigerate.
After the two-three hour rise time when the dough has about doubled, you have two options: bake, or store in the fridge. See notes for how to store.
Preheat the Dutch oven.
30 minutes to an hour before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven in the oven, with the lid ON, while the oven is preheating. Once the oven reaches 450, keep it preheating for another 20 minutes, so the Dutch oven gets good and hot.
Flour parchment paper and add dough.
Scrape the dough into the edge of a piece of parchment paper dusted with flour. Make it into as much of a ""loaf"" shape as you can by folding the edges up on top of it (a silicone spatula works well for this).
Shape the loaf.
Then, use the edges of the parchment paper to flip the loaf over so the floured side is on top and the loaf is in the center of the parchment paper. Don't worry about it looking beautiful or smooth on top. My Dutch oven is an oval, so I made an oval shape. You can do a circle if yours is round.
Score the loaf.
Optional: use a very sharp knife or clean razor blade to cut a few slits across the top of the loaf about 1/2"" deep, across the entire top. I did this in a cross shape for mine.
Place loaf in hot Dutch oven carefully.
Take out the preheated Dutch oven and take off the lid, carefully! Grab the parchment from the sides and place the loaf in your Dutch oven.
Bake.
Place the cover back on the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 35 minutes at 450 degrees F (40 minutes if dough was cold from the fridge). Remove the lid and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until a golden brown color forms- longer if necessary.
