lightened up key lime bars {without condensed milk},"['1 1/2 cup crumbled graham crackers', '1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes', '1 cup pitted dates', '1/4 tsp cinnamon', '1 tbsp coconut oil', '1 1/2 tsp powdered gelatin', '2/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, about 4-5 limes', '2 cups whole milk', '2 eggs', '3/4 cup sugar', '3 tbsp cornstarch', 'unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted', 'powdered sugar']",,"Grab an 8×8 inch pan. Line it with parchment paper leaving extra to hang over the sides for easy removal.
To make the crust, soften your dates. If they look a bit dry and crystalized, soak in warm water to reconstitute. Remove the pits. In a food processor, add the graham crackers, coconut flakes, dates, cinnamon and coconut oil. Process until the mixture resembles wet sand. It should look crumbly but come together when pressed in your hands. If not, add a tiny bit of water to get it going. Then, press the crumbs down into your lined pan to make your crust.
For the pastry cream, place the gelatin and a splash of water in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
Juice the limes. An electric juicer or citrus reamer works really well. Set aside.
Bring the milk to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and cornstarch until well combined. To temper the eggs, slowly whisk about ½ cup of the warm milk into the egg mixture, stirring constantly (do not pour all at once or else the eggs will scramble). Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the pan of milk. Add the gelatin and lime juice. Increase the heat to medium-low, and cook stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until it has thickened, about 1-3 minutes . Strain the mixture through a fine sieve directly over your prepared crust. Smooth out the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap (touching the surface of the pastry cream) so that it does not form a skin. Leave to cool at room temperature for an hour and then transfer to the fridge to chill overnight.
When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap. Then remove the the pie from the pan.

Please use a cloth lined bowl (instead of the Dutch oven) for the second rise.', 'You will need a 5 1/2 or 6 quart Dutch oven for baking', 'This recipe was tested with King Arthur Bread Flour, Gold Medal Bread Flour, Pillsbury Bread Flour']",,"Make The Dough
In a large bowl, add the sourdough starter, water and olive oil. Mix with a fork to combine. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing with your fork until the dough becomes stiff. Then squish everything together with your hands to incorporate all of the four. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, if preferred.
After the dough has rested: return to the bowl and work the dough into a rough ball, about 15 seconds.
Bulk Rise
Now the dough needs to rise. Cover the bowl with lightly oiled plastic wrap (alternatively, transfer the dough to a high-sided dough tub with lid and measuring marks). Let rest in a warm spot to rise, ideally 70-75 F. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has almost doubled in size.
Optional Step: Stretch & Fold The Dough
Cut & Shape The Dough
Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping).
Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it.
Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf.
To shape: use a bench knife to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle.
Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance.
Second Rise
Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time.
Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside of the pot for a “free form” second rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cover with the lid of the pot. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size.
Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise.
Score The Dough
Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, razor blade, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep.
Bake The Dough
Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures.
You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C.

Beginner's Guide To Sourdough Focaccia Bread,"['50-75 g bubbly, active sourdough starter', '375 g water (see Notes below)', '20 g honey (optional)', '500 g bread flour or all purpose flour (see Notes below)', '9 g fine sea salt', '2-3 tbsp olive oil, for coating the pan', 'Assorted Toppings (optional): rosemary, garlic cloves, flaky seat salt, tomatoes, olives etc.', 'Thoughts on Flour: You can use bread flour or all purpose flour to make sourdough focaccia. Comparatively speaking, bread flour yields a slightly chewier focaccia with a higher rise. All purpose flour creates a more tender focaccia. The choice is up to you. If you prefer to use all purpose flour, I do recommend King Arthur brand. Coming in at over 11.7% protein, this flour is stronger than most all purpose flours, which means it can handle a higher quantity of water without the dough becoming a gloppy mess. It’s actually stronger than most bread flours! If you cannot access this flour, make the following changes to ensure success: decrease the water to 325-350 g (start small and work your way up) OR use King Arthur bread flour with 375 g water instead.', 'Thoughts on Sourdough Starter (quantity): When the weather is cold, I’ll use a higher amount of starter to give the dough a boost when doing a long, overnight rise. I’ve given you a range so you can decide what suits you best.', 'For Baking: You will need a rimmed sheet pan or non-stick rectangular pan (9×13-inch or 10×14-inch)']",,"Make the Dough:
In the evening: whisk the sourdough starter, water and honey together in a large bowl (I use a fork for mixing). Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine and then finish by hand to form a rough dough. It will be wet and sticky. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour. Timing is flexible here. Then return to the bowl and work the dough into a ball.
Bulk Rise
Cover the bowl of dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap (or transfer the dough to a lightly oiled dough container). Let the dough rise overnight at room temperature, approximately 68-70 F (20-21 C) for about 12+ hours. The dough will double in size (or more) when ready. Note: if the weather is warmer than 68- 70 F (20-21 C) the dough will rise faster than 12+ hrs. Please adjust your timeframes accordingly.
Second Rise
In the morning, pour 2 tbsp. of olive oil onto a rimmed sheet pan (or 1 tbsp. olive oil if using a non-stick rectangular pan). Use your hands to evenly coat the bottom and sides. With your oiled hands, remove the dough onto the pan, and then flip it to coat both sides. Cover and let rest for 1 1/2- 2 hours or until very puffy (I use an inverted sheet pan to cover the dough). Preheat your oven to 425 F (220 C). Note: I like to rest my dough in a warm spot, usually on top of the oven while it preheats. The dough becomes soft and bubbly.
Assemble the Focaccia
Right before baking, gently dimple the dough with oiled fingertips. I start at the bottom of the pan and work my way to the top. As you dimple, the dough will naturally begin to stretch outwards. You should end up with a rustic rectangular or oval shape, about 14 x 9-inches (36 x 23 cm) or larger. The dough won’t go all the way to the corners and sides of the sheet pan- this is OK. Note: If using a rectangular pan, the dough will naturally fill the shape of the pan.
Add Focaccia Toppings (optional)
Press your preferred toppings into the dough. As the focaccia rises, the dough will puff up. The toppings will pop out if not properly anchored. If using garlic, I keep the cloves wrapped in their papery peels to prevent burning. Remove and discard the peels before eating.
Bake the Focaccia
Place the dough onto the center rack. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before cutting. TIP: To par-bake focaccia dough: Bake for approximately 15-18 minutes @ 425 F (220 C). The crust will be set, very pale in color and golden underneath. Remove the focaccia from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Once completely cool, wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 6 hrs. To finish, return to the pan and bake for 12-15 minutes.

Make the dough in the evening and let rise overnight. The following morning, roll, cut and shape the dough. Rest for 1-2 hours (second rise) before baking.
As an alternative, after resting for 1 hour, cover the dough and chill until ready to use. Rest at room temperature before baking. The dough should be plump and puffy before baking.
Make-Ahead Option (Freeze): Place the cut & shaped cinnamon rolls into a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. Cover with two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze until ready to use. The night before baking, remove the old plastic wrap and replace with fresh wrap (this prevents any condensation from dripping onto the rolls). Defrost overnight, about 10-12 hrs. at room temperature, approximately 67 F. Bake the following morning as directed.
Make the Dough
In the evening: Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl. Cool slightly before using.
Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour.
Bulk Rise
Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature.
Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough.
Roll the Dough
In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way.
Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling.
Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again.
Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling
If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges.
If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy.

Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again.
Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size.
Second Rise
Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe.
Bake the Cinnamon Rolls
Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready.
Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack.
Make the Glaze
While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results.
To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked.",en,True,,False,True

Start the night before, in the evening, and plan to bake the following day. If it’s warmer than 68 F the dough will take less time to rise. Alternatively, start in the morning and bake in the afternoon or evening.
Mix the Dough
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour, butter, sugar and salt. Mix on low speed until combined; the butter should look like crumbs.
Add the starter and warm water. Mix until the flour is fully absorbed (get in there with your hands to finish mixing). The dough will feel slightly sticky and elastic at this stage. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, replenish you starter with fresh flour and water.
After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook and run the machine on medium-low (#3 on a KitchenAid) for 6-8 minutes. The dough will feel soft and supple and not stick to your hands. If it does, add a dusting of flour.
Note
If you do not have a stand mixer, the dough can be made by hand. After mixing and resting for 30 minutes, knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 8-10 minutes, or until smooth, soft and elastic. Do not worry about under/over kneading. Relax into the process and focus on the texture, not the time.
Bulk Rise
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise overnight at room temperature (68 F) until double in size, about 10-12 hrs. Please refer to the Baking Schedule above for additional rise time options.
Shape the Dough
In the morning, coat an 8.5×4 inch loaf pan with butter.
Remove the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently flatten the surface to release any large air bubbles.
Roll the dough into a log tucking the ends underneath. Rest for 5-10 minutes. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you to tighten its shape. Using a bench knife, place the dough into the loaf pan seam side down.
Second Rise
Cover the dough with lightly oiled or buttered plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature until it has risen to about 1-inch above the rim of the pan (check the height by looking at the domed center portion of the dough). You are not looking for it to double in size. For timing, this can take anywhere from 1 1/2-2 hours (or more!) depending on temperature and the amount of sourdough starter used. Remember, the warmer it is, the faster the dough will rise. Refer to the “helpful tips” at the top of this post.
Preheat your oven to 375 F. Note: For higher oven spring, preheat to 500 F instead. Reduce to 375 F once the dough goes into the oven and bake as directed.
Bake the Dough
Bake the dough on the center rack for about 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown.
Cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes, and then transfer to a rack to cool completely.

Weigh the eggs (cracked) in a small bowl. If the weight is less than 165 g, use olive oil to make up the difference.
Add the sourdough starter to the eggs; whisk thoroughly to combine.
Add the flour to a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the egg mixture.
Process the ingredients (no need to pulse) until a dough forms, about 10-15 seconds. If the dough doesn’t form into a ball, and looks “crumbly” it’s OK. Unplug the food processor and pinch the dough together; if it sticks, it’s fine.
Remove the dough to your work surface. Form into a rough ball. Cover with an upturned bowl and let rest for 10 minutes before kneading. It will be easier to work with.
After resting, knead the dough (see video at 1:50 mark). Do this by pushing the heel of your hand into the dough, and then turning the dough over itself. Repeat this technique several times, in a continued rocking motion, until a smooth ball forms, about 1-2 minutes. If the texture is sticky as you knead the dough, add a sprinkle of flour. When finished, wrap the dough very tightly in plastic wrap.
Now the dough needs to rest. Choose a fermentation option: for a same day dough, rest at room temperature (68- 75 F) for 1 hour. Alternatively, to maximize fermentation and digestibility, rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours, and chill overnight, up to 24 hrs. Whichever option you choose, the dough must be wrapped tightly; it will rise slightly. Note: before rolling, chilled dough must rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. Otherwise, it will be too stiff.

Step #2: Roll The Dough Into Pasta Sheets
Set up your station: Dust your work surface, a sheet pan, and the pasta machine with semolina flour to prevent sticking.
Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces; flatten one piece into a thin 6-8-inch oval disc (re-wrap the remaining pieces so they don’t dry out). Use a rolling pin.
Send the disc through the roller on the lowest/widest setting. This is “#1” on the Kitchen Aid attachment displayed above. Now, send it through again. Note: if using a pasta machine, refer to their specific instructions for rolling the dough. The settings are different, but the rolling process is the same.
Continue to roll the dough through settings #2-4 (2x on each setting) for spaghetti, fettuccine, pappardelle and tagliatelle. For homemade ravioli, the dough needs to be thinner- go up to #5. The higher the number, the thinner the dough will become. That’s the goal. The pasta sheet is ready when it’s slightly translucent and you can see your hand underneath.
When finished, fold the pasta sheet in half, place onto a tray and cover.
Repeat the rolling process for the remaining 3 pieces of dough.
Before cutting: I like to semi-dry or “cure” the pasta sheets ever so slightly. This gives the cut pasta strands a more firm and “leathery” finish, rather than a soft and doughy feel (this helps to prevent the strands from sticking together later on).
To semi-dry: Hang the pasta sheets over the back of a chair or on a rod for about 5-15 minutes. Keep your eye on the time; you don’t want the sheets to dry out completely. Touch them occasionally. You will feel the difference in texture as time goes by.
To cut: Take a pasta sheet and cut in half. Send it through the cutter attachment. I used the spaghetti shape above.
Dust the pasta noodles liberally with semolina flour to prevent sticking- don’t skimp here. Arrange strands loosely on a tray.

Feeding Sourdough Starter: My Best Tips & Tricks,"['Sourdough Starter', 'Jar with lid (I use this one)', 'Digital Kitchen Scale', 'Bread flour or all purpose', 'Water, filtered or regular quality tap water']",,"Remove and discard half of your sourdough starter from the jar.
Feed what’s left in the jar with equal parts flour and water by weight (1:1:1 feeding ratio). You need a digital kitchen scale for this. Because we all work with different quantities of starters, this 1:1:1 feeding ratio is best understood by example. So, if you have 60 g of starter in the jar, feed it with 60 g flour + 60 g water. If you have 30 g of starter, feed it with 30 g of flour and 30 g of water. Mix well with a fork, scraping down the sides as needed. Cover the jar with a lid. The lid can be airtight or loosely placed on top- your choice. Note: if the jar is airtight, the pressure will build up fast. Keep an eye on the jar so it doesn’t burst.
Let your starter rise at room temperature, ideally 75+ F (the warmer it is, the faster it will rise), until bubbly, active and double in size (2-12 hrs). When your starter is at peak height, it’s ready to use. Eventually it will fall back down, and become inactive again. Then, you’ll need to repeat the feeding process.",en,True,,True,True

Add the flours and salt. Combine to form a stiff dough, then finish mixing by hand to fully incorporate the flour. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
Add the Fillings: After the dough has rested, add the olives, thyme, lemon zest and parmesan cheese (if using) to the bowl. Gently knead the fillings into the dough, using the stretch and fold technique, To do this: stretch the dough upward and fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the dough a turn and repeat (stretching, folding and turning) until the fillings are tucked into the dough.
Bulk Rise: Cover the bowl with lightly coated plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until double in size. This will take about 8 to 10 hours at 70 F (21 C). Note: if making the dough in the summer, the rise time will be considerably less; bulk rise during the day and chill the whole bowl overnight when almost double in size. Optional Step: If you’d like, for added structure, do 1-2 sets of stretch and folds during the bulk rise, spaced 30 minutes apart.
Shape: Remove the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a round or oval and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a proofing basket with a towel and dust with flour. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you to tighten its shape. Then place the dough into your basket, seam side up.
Second Rise: Cover the dough and let rest until noticeably puffy but not fully risen, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on temperature. Alternatively, chill the dough overnight, up to 8 hours. Let rest at room temperature while the oven heats up before baking. Preheat your oven to 450 F (230 C). Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot.
Score: Place the parchment over the dough and invert the basket to release. Sprinkle the dough very lightly with flour and rub the surface to coat.

This will ensure the correct texture of the dough. If your eggs are too small, the dough will be dry and crumbly.', 'Wrap it up. Pasta dough can dry out quickly. Keep it covered with wrap or a kitchen towel.']",,"Step #1: Make The Dough
Add the flour to a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add the eggs and yolk.
Whisk together with a fork, and then combine with the flour. When the texture becomes stiff, finish by hand to form a rough dough. If dry bits of flour remain after a few minutes of mixing (be patient, it’s a dry dough) add a few drops of water or olive oil to bring the dough together.
Form the dough into a ball, cover with an upturned bowl or with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 10-15 minutes- it will be easier to knead.
Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes. Do this by folding the dough over itself, pushing it forward with the heel of your hand, turning slightly as you go. I literally rock the dough back and forth (watch the video). The texture will be very stiff at first- it’s not bread dough. But rest assured, by the 2 minute mark it will start to soften. Keep kneading until the dough is soft, malleable and has a talcum-like finish. It should “bounce back” slowly when poked.
Form the dough into a ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Step #2: Roll The Dough Into Pasta Sheets
On your work surface, cut the pasta dough into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough into a 6-8inch oval patty. Keep the remaining doughs covered in wrap otherwise they will dry out.
Set the pasta roller to #1 which is the lowest/widest setting on the Kitchen Aid. With the machine running, send the dough through the roller. Now, send it through again (so, 2x total). Note: if you are using a hand crank pasta machine, refer to the manufacture’s specific instructions for rolling the dough- the settings might differ but the process is the same.
Continue to roll the dough through settings #2-4, (2x) on each setting. Do not pull on the sheet as it comes through the roller; just guide it along gently. If at any point the dough becomes sticky, dust with semolina flour. I keep my work surface dusted with semolina at all times. This way I can coat both sides of my pasta sheet easily and quickly while I work.
Your pasta sheet is ready when it’s beautifully thin and somewhat translucent (you should be able to see your hand underneath). Don’t worry if the ends are not perfectly straight; you can always trim them with a knife.
To finish, dust the pasta sheet generously with semolina, fold it in half, and place onto your floured sheet pan. Cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat the rolling process for the remaining 3 doughs.
Step #3: Cut The Pasta
Before cutting, I like to dry my pasta sheets ever so slightly. This firms up the final texture giving the strands a more “leathery” finish, rather than a soft and doughy feel (this will prevent the pasta from sticking together later on).
To Dry
Hang the pasta sheets over the back of a chair for about 10-15 minutes or so. Keep your eye on the time; you don’t want the sheets to dry out completely. You will be able to feel the difference.

Add the flour, eggs and olive oil (if using) to a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process to form dough, about 15-20 seconds. Remove to your work surface and cover with an upturned bowl for 5 minutes- it will be much easier to knead in the next step. Then, knead the dough into a ball, about 1-2 minutes (don’t worry about technique here, the food processor does most of the kneading for you). Cover again, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour to relax the gluten. I prefer a 1 hour rest for long pasta sheets. Tip: Use this resting time to make the ravioli filling.
Make the Ravioli Filling
Combine the drained ricotta, mascarpone, chopped basil leaves, Parmesan cheese and egg. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Give it a taste (it should be highly seasoned). Cover and chill until ready to use. This step can be done 1-2 days in advance.
Set up your work station: Choose a large, clutter-free work surface to spread out (I like the kitchen table). Dust your work surface and the pasta machine/roller with semolina flour to prevent sticking. Line (2x) sheet pans with parchment paper, no overhang. Cut 4 additional pieces to layer in between the pasta sheets as you roll them out; set aside.
Roll Pasta Dough Into Sheets
Cut the pasta dough into 4 equal pieces. Flatten one piece into an 5×8-inch long disc (re-wrap or cover the remaining pieces so they don’t dry out). A rolling pin helps with this step.
Send the disc through the roller on the widest/lowest setting. This is “#1” on the Kitchen Aid attachment. Send it through a second time. Note: if using a hand-crank pasta machine, refer to their specific instructions for rolling pasta sheets for ravioli. The process is the same, but the settings are different.
Continue to roll the dough through settings #2-5 (2x on each setting), dusting with semolina flour in between if the pasta gets sticky. You can also cut the sheet in half if it gets too long. The pasta sheet is ready when it’s slightly translucent and you can see your hand underneath, about 1 mm thick.
When finished, lightly trim the rounded edges. Cut into 10-12-inch long sheets. The sheets do not have to look perfect- you’ll trim more later on. Place onto your sheet pan and cover with parchment paper. Repeat to roll the remaining 3 pieces of dough.
Assemble & Cut Ravioli:
Grab a pasta sheet. Dollop the cheese filling (in rounded teaspoons), down the center of the sheet, spaced 2 finger widths apart. Place a second sheet on top, like making a sandwich. (Tip: If you’re feeling confident, you can do two rows of filling, instead of one. Two rows is not necessarily harder; it requires more practice and patience when smoothing out the pasta sheets. You will have enough cheese filling to do so, and your total number of ravioli will increase. Perhaps start with one row, and then work your way up if you’re in the mood).
Smooth the pasta sheet with your fingertips, working around the filling to get the air bubbles out. Press to seal the edges and sides. Refer to my video for guidance.
Cut the ravioli in half and then into strips. Trim into 2 1/2- 3-inch ravioli squares. Transfer the ravioli to the remaining parchment-lined sheet pan dusted with semolina flour. Cover with towel or an inverted sheet pan. Repeat to assemble and cut the remaining ravioli.

If using fresh tomatoes, you’ll need to blanch them first to remove the tough skins (see below). If using canned tomatoes, skip the blanching step and jump straight to cooking. You’ll need to chop them into small pieces first, and add to the pan with their juice.
To Blanch Tomatoes:
Boil a large pot of water. Cut a small X on the bottom of each tomato (the skin will peel off easier). Blanch the tomatoes for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon; do not drain the pot of water. Run the tomatoes under cold water to stop the cooking process. Remove the skins with your hands- they should slip right off. Next, slice the tomatoes in half and scoop out the seeds (I do this over a bowl). Dice the tomatoes into small pieces. At this point, the blanched, chopped tomatoes can be stored in the fridge up to 4 days or frozen up to 3 months.
Tip
Save the blanching water to cook the pasta (or save it to water your plants or garden if not using right away).
To Cook Pomodoro Sauce:
In a large 12-inch (30 cm) skillet warm the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions or shallots (if using) until soft and translucent, 5-7 minutes. Add the smashed garlic clove; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
Add the tomatoes to the pan. Season with salt. Give it a quick stir with a wooden spoon. Bring to a gentle boil, lower the heat and simmer until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 15-20 minutes depending on variety (the juicier the tomatoes the longer it will take to cook). Towards the end of cooking, tear the fresh basil leaves into small pieces and stir into the sauce.
To finish, remove the garlic clove. Puree the sauce with an immersion blender or regular blender to create a semi-rustic or smooth texture. Or, don’t puree at all- your choice. Your sauce. Taste and correct with more salt, if needed.
To Serve with Pasta:
Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Meanwhile, have your pomodoro sauce simmering and ready to go in a 12-inch pan (the pasta will finish cooking in the sauce). When the pasta is aldente, use tongs or a small strainer to transfer it into the pan. Add the butter if using, and stir well. Shave some parmesan cheese over the pasta; toss to coat. Simmer and toss for 30 seconds. Transfer your delicious pasta al pomodoro to a large serving bowl and garnish with fresh basil on top. Enjoy!",en,True,,False,False

I like pre-cut sheets for convenience', 'Sheet pan', 'Digital scale', 'Fluted ravioli cutter (or large knife)']",,"Roast the Butternut Squash
Place a whole, unpeeled butternut squash onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Bake at 400 F for approximately 1 hour or more, depending on size. A sharp knife will easily slip out when it’s ready. Cool for 20 minutes or so, and then peel off the skin. Scoop out the seeds. Process in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Chill (or freeze) until ready to make the butternut squash filling, as per the instructions below.
Make Pasta Dough: Add the flour, eggs and olive oil (if using) to a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process to form dough, about 15-20 seconds. Remove to your work surface and cover with an upturned bowl for 5 minutes- it will be much easier to knead in the next step. Then, knead the dough into a ball, about 1-2 minutes (don’t worry about technique here, the food processor does most of the kneading for you). Cover again, and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour to relax the gluten. I prefer a 1 hour rest for long pasta sheets. Tip: Use this resting time to make the filling.
Make the Butternut Squash Filling
Heat the roasted butternut squash, butter and nutmeg together in a small pot. Stir occasionally with a rubber spatula so the mixture doesn’t stick to the bottom. Taste and season with salt, if needed. Transfer to a bowl. Chill for 1 hour. You cannot use hot filling to assemble ravioli; the dough will get soggy.
Set Up Your Work Station For The Ravioli: Choose a large, clutter-free work surface to spread out (I like the kitchen table). Dust your work surface and the pasta machine/roller with semolina flour to prevent sticking. Line (2x) sheet pans with parchment paper, no overhang. Cut 4 additional pieces to layer in between the pasta sheets as you roll them out; set aside.
Roll Pasta Dough Into Sheets: Cut the pasta dough into 4 equal pieces. Flatten one piece into an 5×8-inch long disc (re-wrap or cover the remaining pieces so they don’t dry out). A rolling pin helps with this step.
Send the disc through the roller on the widest/lowest setting. This is “#1” on the Kitchen Aid attachment. Send it through a second time. Note: if using a hand-crank pasta machine, refer to their specific instructions for rolling pasta sheets for ravioli. The process is the same, but the settings are different.
Continue to roll the dough through settings #2-5 (2x on each setting), dusting with semolina flour in between if the pasta gets sticky. You can also cut the sheet in half if it gets too long. The pasta sheet is ready when it’s slightly translucent and you can see your hand underneath, about 1 mm thick.
When finished, lightly trim the rounded edges. Cut into 10-12-inch long sheets. The sheets do not have to look perfect- you’ll trim more later on. Place onto your sheet pan and cover with parchment paper. Repeat to roll the remaining 3 pieces of dough.
Assemble & Cut Ravioli: Grab a pasta sheet. Dollop the butternut squash filling (in rounded teaspoons), down the center of the sheet, spaced 2 finger widths apart. Place a second sheet on top, like making a sandwich. (Tip: If you’re feeling confident, you can do two rows of filling, instead of one. Two rows is not necessarily harder; it requires more practice and patience when smoothing out the pasta sheets. You will have enough filling to do so, and your total number of ravioli will increase. Perhaps start with one row, and then work your way up).
Smooth the pasta sheet with your fingertips, working around the filling to get the air bubbles out. Press to seal the edges and sides.
Cut the ravioli in half and then into strips. Trim into 2 1/2- 3-inch ravioli squares. Transfer the ravioli to the remaining parchment-lined sheet pan dusted with semolina flour. Cover with towel or an inverted sheet pan. Repeat to assemble and cut the remaining ravioli.
To Cook & Serve
Boil a pot of water; salt it generously.
Meanwhile, cook the pancetta until slightly crisp. Transfer to a paper towel to drain.
Start the butter and sage sauce. To control timing, I usually undercook the sauce slightly. The butter will continue to get toasty, like brown butter, as the pan sits off the heat.
Working in batches, cook the ravioli.I recommend doing a test batch first with 1-2 ravioli to gauge the correct cooking time. Plan on 3-6 minutes or more, depending on thickness. The thicker the pasta, the longer the ravioli will take to cook. Taste for doneness. When finished, gently transfer the ravioli to a serving dish with a slotted spoon or fine mesh strainer- be careful, they are delicate!

Make The Pasta (full instructions here). Roll the pasta dough into sheets, approximately .60 mm thick (#4 setting on the KitchenAid pasta roller attachment). Cut the sheets into lasagna noodles to fit a 9×13-inch baking pan. Mine are usually about 5 to 6 x 8 inches long. Save any scraps to make additional layers.
Parboil The Pasta
Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil; season with 1 tbsp. fine sea salt. Add 1-2 lasagna noodles and wait until they floats. Boil for only 30 seconds. The noodles will finish cooking in the oven. Remove with a small strainer and plunge into an ice bath to rinse off the sticky starch. Dry on clean kitchen towels.
Layer & Assemble The Lasagna
Spread 1/4 cup béchamel sauce on the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to spread it out. Lay (2) lasagna sheets on top, slightly overlapping.
Top with 1 cup ragù, spreading it all the way to the corner and sides.
Add 1/2 cup béchamel on top of the ragù; thoroughly mix the sauces together. It should look pink and messy. This step binds the sauces together, adding height to the lasagna layers.
Finally, top with a generous handful of ground Parmesan cheese, about 1/4 cup .
Repeat the layering process (ragù, béchamel & Parmesan cheese) until you get to the last layer of pasta. At this point, top the last layer with 1/2 cup béchamel sauce, and only a few dollops of ragù for color. Swirl together. Top with plenty of Parmesan cheese- don’t be shy. You should end up with 5-6 layers of lasagna, depending on how thin the pasta was rolled.

In a separate bowl, sift together the flour baking powder and salt.
With the mixer running, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix until just combined. Note: if the dough is too sticky, add more flour, 1 tbsp at a time. The texture should be soft and malleable, but not overly wet and sticky. You will be hand-rolling the dough in the next step.
Scoop the dough onto a lightly floured surface (I use a fine mesh strainer to evenly dust my work surface to prevent sticking). With floured hands, gently form the dough into a ball. Divide the ball in half. Roll each half into a thick log, about 8 inches long by 2 inches wide. To do so: lift the dough up and roll the logs vertically in between your palms, gently stretching them to size. Alternatively, roll the logs on your work surface.
Set the logs onto your baking sheet spaced 5 inches apart. Brush off any residual flour on the surface. Gently flatten the logs to 2 1/2- 2 3/4-inches wide.
Bake on the center rack for 25-30 minutes. This is your first bake. When ready, the logs will be light in color and just starting to turn golden around the edges. There will be cracks on the surface- all normal.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Transfer the logs a wire rack to cool, about 20-30 minutes.

Place the brown sugar, maple syrup, orange juice, mustard, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Boil for another 5-10 minutes until thicker and reduced to a syrup consistency. Remove from the heat.
Remove the lid or foil from the ham. Baste the ham with half of the sauce, covering the top and sides where the fat is scored. Do not use all the glaze now; use about half of the glaze. Add a cup or two of water to the bottom of the pan. This will help keep the ginger ale from burning if you want to make the sauce for the ham.
Turn the oven temperature up to 350℉ and continue to bake. Baste the ham with the remainder of the glaze again after 15 minutes, then continue to cook. Re-baste the ham every 10 minutes, using the drippings in the pan, until the ham's internal temperature reaches a minimum of 145°F. If the glaze isn't sticky and dark brown, broil for 4-5 minutes at the end to achieve this.
Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest for ham for 15 minutes.
If desired, take the drippings and place in a saucepan. Add some more ginger ale if needed. Create the cornstarch slurry. Heat the drippings to a simmer, then whisk in the slurry until the sauce has thickened. Remove and place into a gravy boat.
Remove the ham and slice.

Easter Bread (Ukrainian Babka),"['1 cup butter (see notes)', '2 cups whole milk', '¾ cup granulated sugar', '½ teaspoon saffron ( or turmeric)', '6 large egg yolks (beaten - reserve some of the egg white for brushing tops)', '2 teaspoons salt', '1 cup ice water (( I add ice))', '½ cup water (very warm )', '1 teaspoon granulated sugar', '2 tablespoons traditional yeast', '8-9 cups all-purpose flour', '2 cups Thompson raisins']",,"Prepare the Scalded Milk Mixture
Place the butter, whole milk, and ¾ cup of white sugar in a small saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until the butter and sugar are dissolved. To scald the milk, continue to heat the mixture until the milk is steaming, then remove from the heat. Do not let it boil. You can also do this in the microwave (my Mom's trick) in a large glass microwave-safe measuring cup.
Add in the saffron or the turmeric and stir to dissolve. Once the color has leeched from the saffron you can remove the threads if they aren't dissolved.
Stir in the cup of ice water and let the mixture cool.
Once cooled, whisk the beaten egg yolks into the mixture. Stir in the salt.
Proof the Yeast
In the mixing bowl of your stand mixer, place ½ cup of very warm water and 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar. Mix together, then add the yeast. Stir until the yeast starts to dissolve, then let sit until the entire mixture is bubbling.
Make the Dough
Once the yeast has been proofed, pour the egg mixture into the mixing bowl. Attach your dough hook.
Add in the first four cups of flour into the mixing bowl, and using the dough hook, mix on low until combined. Add in the raisins next and mix in.
Add in the next 4 cups of flour, mixing in slowly with the dough hook. Add enough flour until the dough barely sticks to your hands, is pulling away from the sides of the bowl, and is starting to smooth out.
Knead for another 5 minutes with the dough hook.
Turn the dough out into a well-oiled large plastic bowl ( the largest Tupperware container is the perfect size for this) and cover with a damp, clean kitchen towel. Place in a warm place for an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
Once the dough is ready, punch it down into the bowl and knead it a few times to compress it again. Grease your coffee tins or bread pans thoroughly. Place a dough ball that fills approximately one-third of the coffee can, making sure that the smooth side of the dough ball faces up and any seams are in the bottom of the can. This made ten 300-gram dough balls for my ten coffee tins.
Remove all the oven racks except the very bottom rack. Place the tins on the rack a couple of inches apart for airflow, and then cover them again with a damp kitchen towel.
Once the dough has reached the top of the can - around 90 minutes for me sometimes - remove the towel, leave the bread in the oven, and preheat your oven to 325℉.
For the coffee tins, bake for 25 minutes, placing aluminum foil on top when the tops start to get too brown - they always will after a mere few minutes in the oven. Remove the foil and brush some of the leftover beaten egg white on top of the loaves. Continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes. The bread will sound hollow when tapped and be a dark brown on top when done.
If they stick slightly in the tins, twist and shake gently at the same time, they will pop right out. If they stick in the loaf pans, run a knife along the edge to free the bread then remove safely.

Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough that only slightly sticks to your hands. Let the dough hook knead the dough for another 4-5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Alternatively if you don't have a mixer, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and then knead until smooth and elastic, around 8-10 minutes.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning the dough around to grease all sides to prevent it from drying.Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

Transfer to a clean plate and repeat the process with 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon oil, and the remaining 4 cutlets. (Do not wipe out the pan between batches unless flour is burning). Reduce the heat to medium-low.
In the same skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onion, and cook until it is translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and tomato paste to the pan. Stir and cook for until the garlic is fragrant and the tomato paste has turned darker in color, 1 minute. Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any brown bits. Let the wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.
Stir in the chicken stock, sun-dried tomatoes, and Italian seasoning, and bring to a simmer. Once the sauce is simmering, add the chicken and any accumulated juices back into the pan; cook for 5 minutes. (The sauce should be thickened slightly.) Stir in the cream and parmesan, and let simmer for 5 minutes more to make sure the chicken is tender and all the flavors have melded.

Strawberry Shortcake Sandwich Cookies,"['1/2 c. freeze-dried strawberries', '1 2/3 c. all-purpose flour', '1 tbsp. cornstarch', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt', '3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) salted butter, at room temperature', '1/3 c. powdered sugar', '1 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract', '4 tbsp. salted butter, at room temperature', '1 tbsp. skim milk powder (optional)', '1 tsp. milk', '1/4 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract', 'Pinch of kosher salt', '3/4 c. powdered sugar', '3 tbsp. strawberry jam']",,"For the cookies: In a food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries until they become a fine powder (you should have about 2 tablespoons). Sift through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl to remove any larger pieces and set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and salt; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and powdered sugar and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and slowly add the flour mixture, mixing until just combined, about 1 minute. Give a final stir with the spatula to make sure there are no visible traces of flour.
Divide the dough in half. Set one half of the dough aside and leave the remaining dough in the stand mixer. Add the strawberry powder to the mixer and mix on low speed until the powder is completely incorporated and the dough is pink. Lightly knead the dough by hand so it comes together. Lightly knead the reserved plain dough as well until it comes together. Form each portion into a log approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 6 inches long, gently squeezing the dough as you work to keep it intact (the dough will be slightly crumbly). Wrap each log in plastic and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Unwrap one log and cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Place the rounds on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart (they can be close together since they do not spread while baking).
Bake the cookies, rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until they are set and barely golden on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a cooling rack and allow them to cool completely. Let the baking sheets cool before repeating with the remaining dough log.
For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and skim milk powder, if using, and beat on medium speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Mix in the milk, vanilla, and salt until fully incorporated. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the powdered sugar. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed, and beat the frosting until fluffy and combined, about 3 minutes.
Transfer the frosting to a piping bag or plastic zip-top bag and cut off the tip. Match up the strawberry and vanilla cookies so you have same-size pairs and line them up on a baking sheet. Flip the strawberry cookies bottom-side up and pipe a circle of frosting around the edge of each (leave an open space in the center). Spoon about 1/4 teaspoon strawberry jam in the center of each. Sandwich each with a vanilla cookie, bottom-side down.
Let the cookies rest for 30 minutes so the frosting sets and the cookies soften slightly.",en,True,,False,True

Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover and let sit for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. In a large skillet, bring 2 quarts salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and cook until bright green and just tender, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the broccoli to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and pat dry. Empty and dry the skillet.
In a large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, sesame oil, and the remaining ⅓ cup chicken broth, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Place the remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch in a medium bowl and add 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce mixture, whisking well to form a slurry.
In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken in a single layer to the hot pan and allow to cook undisturbed until brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook for another 30 seconds before removing the chicken to a plate. Add the ginger, garlic, and green onion whites. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in the soy sauce mixture and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken and broccoli to the skillet. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the slurry mixture and simmer until the sauce is glossy and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes, adding more slurry, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the sauce is too thin.

Eggs Benedict,"['3 whole English muffins', '6 slices Canadian bacon', '1 c. butter, plus more for the muffins', '6 whole eggs (plus 3 egg yolks)', '1 lemon, juiced', 'Cayenne pepper, to taste', 'Paprika, to garnish', 'Chopped chives, to garnish']",,"Bring a pot of water to a boil. While the water's boiling, place the English muffin halves and an equal number of Canadian bacon slices on a cookie sheet. Lightly butter the English muffins and place the sheet under the broiler for just a few minutes, or until the English muffins are very lightly golden. Be careful not to dry out the Canadian bacon.
Now if you do not have an egg poacher you can poach your eggs by doing the following: With a spoon, begin stirring the boiling water in a large, circular motion. When the tornado's really twisting, crack in an egg. The reason for the swirling is so the egg will wrap around itself as it cooks, keeping it together. Cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
Melt 2 sticks of butter in a small saucepan until sizzling, but don't let it burn! Separate three eggs and place the yolks into a blender. Turn the blender on low to allow the yolks to combine, then begin pouring the very hot butter in a thin stream into the blender. The blender should remain on the whole time, and you should be careful to pour in the butter very slowly. Keep pouring butter until it’s all gone, then immediately begin squeezing lemon juice into the blender. If you are going to add cayenne pepper, this is the point at which you would do that.
Place the English muffins on the plate, face up. Next, place a slice of Canadian bacon on each half. Place an egg on top of the bacon and then top with a generous helping of Hollandaise sauce. Vegetarian variation: you can omit the Canadian bacon altogether, or you can wilt fresh spinach and place it on the muffins for Eggs Florentine, which is divine in its own right. Top with more cayenne, or a sprinkle of paprika, and chopped chives if you like. ",en,True,,False,False

Clean and dry an angel food cake pan very well. Do not grease it or the cake will not rise properly.
In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, vanilla bean paste, almond extract, and salt on medium-high speed until a bit frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the cream of tartar and whip on high until the mixture forms soft peaks, about 3 minutes.
Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and gradually add 1 cup of the granulated sugar while the mixer is running. Increase the speed to high and continue whipping until the mixture is glossy, smooth, and holds a stiff peak, about 3 minutes.
In three additions, sift the flour over the top of the beaten egg whites and carefully fold it in by hand using a rubber spatula. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside.
In the stand mixer bowl (no need to clean it out), whip the egg yolks, orange zest, and 2 tablespoons orange juice on high speed until combined. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, a little at a time, continuing to whip until the mixture is fluffy and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Fold in one-third of the whipped egg white batter until incorporated.
Spoon the yellow batter into the bottom of the ungreased angel food cake pan. Top with the remaining egg white batter. Run a knife or thin offset spatula through the batter to break up any large air pockets, moving from side to side but keeping the knife vertical to avoid swirling the batter as much as possible. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula or the back of a spoon.
Bake until the top is lightly golden and cracked and the cake bounces back when lightly pressed, about 40 minutes.
Remove the cake from the oven and flip upside down to cool on the pan’s feet (if your pan does not have feet, then rest the inverted pan on the neck of a heatproof bottle fitted in the center hole). Let the cake cool completely, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
